   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The islands were part of the UK's Jamaican colony until 1962,
when they assumed the status of a separate Crown colony upon
Jamaica's independence. The governor of The Bahamas oversaw affairs
from 1965 to 1973. With Bahamian independence, the islands received
a separate governor in 1973. Although independence was agreed upon
for 1982, the policy was reversed and the islands remain a British
overseas territory. Grand Turk island suffered extensive damage
from Hurricane Maria on 22 September 2017 resulting in loss of
power and communications, as well as damage to housing and
businesses.</subsection>

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
