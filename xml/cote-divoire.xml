   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Various small kingdoms ruled the area of Cote d'Ivoire between
the 15th and 19th centuries, when European explorers arrived and
then began to expand their presence. In 1844, France established a
protectorate. During this period, many of these kingdoms and tribes
fought to maintain their cultural identities - some well into the
20th century. For example, the Sanwi kingdom - originally founded
in the 17th century - tried to break away from Cote d’Ivoire and
establish an independent state in 1969. 

Cote d’Ivoire achieved independence from France in 1960 but has
maintained close ties with France. The export and production of
cocoa and foreign investment drove economic growth that led Cote
d’Ivoire to become one of the most prosperous states in West
Africa. In December 1999, a military coup overthrew the government.
In late 2000, junta leader Robert GUEI held rigged elections and
declared himself the winner. Popular protests forced him to step
aside, and Laurent GBAGBO was elected. In September 2002, Ivoirian
dissidents and members of the military launched a failed coup that
developed into a civil war. In 2003, a cease-fire resulted in
rebels holding the north, the government holding the south, and
peacekeeping forces occupying a buffer zone in the middle. In March
2007, President GBAGBO and former rebel leader Guillaume SORO
signed an agreement in which SORO joined GBAGBO's government as
prime minister. The two agreed to reunite the country by
dismantling the buffer zone, integrating rebel forces into the
national armed forces, and holding elections. In November 2010,
Alassane Dramane OUATTARA won the presidential election, but GBAGBO
refused to hand over power, resulting in five months of violent
conflict. In April 2011, after widespread fighting, GBAGBO was
formally forced from office by armed OUATTARA supporters and UN and
French forces. In 2015, OUATTARA won a second term. In October
2020, OUATTARA won a controversial third presidential term, despite
a two-term limit in the Ivoirian constitution, in an election
boycotted by the opposition. Through political compromise with
OUATTARA, the opposition did participate peacefully in March 2021
legislative elections and won a substantial minority of seats. Also
in March 2021, the International Criminal Court in The Hague ruled
on a final acquittal for GBAGBO, who was on trial for crimes
against humanity, paving the way for GBAGBO’s June 2021 return to
Abidjan. GBAGBO has publicly met with President OUATTARA since his
return in June 2021 as a demonstration of political reconciliation.
The next presidential election is scheduled for 2025. </subsection>

      </subsection>
      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Cote d’Ivoire’s population is likely to continue growing for the
foreseeable future because almost 60% of the populace is younger
than 25 as of 2020, the total fertility rate is holding steady at
about 3.5 children per woman, and contraceptive use is under 30%.
The country will need to improve education, health care, and gender
equality in order to turn its large and growing youth cohort into
human capital. Even prior to 2010 unrest that shuttered schools for
months, access to education was poor, especially for women. The
lack of educational attainment contributes to Cote d’Ivoire’s high
rates of unskilled labor, adolescent pregnancy, and HIV/AIDS
prevalence.Following its independence in 1960, Cote d’Ivoire’s stability
and the blossoming of its labor-intensive cocoa and coffee
industries in the southwest made it an attractive destination for
migrants from other parts of the country and its neighbors,
particularly Burkina Faso. The HOUPHOUET-BOIGNY administration
continued the French colonial policy of encouraging labor
immigration by offering liberal land ownership laws. Foreigners
from West Africa, Europe (mainly France), and Lebanon composed
about 25% of the population by 1998.Ongoing economic decline since the 1980s and the power struggle
after HOUPHOUET-BOIGNY’s death in 1993 ushered in the politics of
"Ivoirite," institutionalizing an Ivoirian identity that further
marginalized northern Ivoirians and scapegoated immigrants. The
hostile Muslim north-Christian south divide snowballed into a 2002
civil war, pushing tens of thousands of foreign migrants, Liberian
refugees, and Ivoirians to flee to war-torn Liberia or other
regional countries and more than a million people to be internally
displaced. Subsequently, violence following the contested 2010
presidential election prompted some 250,000 people to seek refuge
in Liberia and other neighboring countries and again internally
displaced as many as a million people. By July 2012, the majority
had returned home, but ongoing inter-communal tension and armed
conflict continue to force people from their homes.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">in recent years the government of Ivory Coast has helped develop a competitive telecom sector focused on the provision of converged services, thus allowing operators to offer fixed-line and mobile services under a universal services license regime; the fixed internet and broadband sectors remain underdeveloped; this is a legacy of poor international connectivity, which resulted in high wholesale prices, limited bandwidth, and a lack of access for alternative operators to international infrastructure; these limitations were addressed following the landing of a second cable in November 2011; Orange Group has also launched its 20,000km Djoliba cable system, reaching across eight countries in the region, while the 2Africa submarine cable is being developed by a consortium of companies; with a landing station providing connectivity to Côte d'Ivoire, the system is expected to be completed in late 2023 (2022)</note>
         <note title="domestic">1 per 100 fixed-line teledensity; with multiple mobile-cellular service providers competing in the market, mobile subscriptions have increased to 152 per 100 persons (2020)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>

      <subsection title="Military and security forces">Armed Forces of Cote d'Ivoire (Forces Armees de Cote d'Ivoire,
FACI; aka Republican Forces of Ivory Coast, FRCI): Army, Navy, Cote
Air Force, Special Forces; National Gendarmerie (under the Ministry
of Defense); Ministry of Security and Civil Protection: National
Police; Coordination Center for Operational Decisions (a mix of
police, gendarmerie, and FACI personnel for assisting police in

2,000 Special Forces; 1,000 Navy; 1,000 Air Force); 5-10,000
Gendarmerie (2022)</subsection>
      <subsection title="Military equipment inventories and acquisitions">the inventory of the FACI consists mostly of older or
second-hand equipment, typically of French or Soviet-era origin;
Cote d'Ivoire was under a partial UN arms embargo from 2004 to
2016; in recent years it has received limited amounts of mostly
second-hand equipment from several countries, including France
(2022)</subsection>
      <subsection title="Military service age and obligation">18-25 years of age for compulsory and voluntary male and female
military service; conscription is not enforced; voluntary
recruitment of former rebels into the new national army is
restricted to ages 22-29 (2022)</subsection>
      <subsection title="Military deployments">850 Mali (MINUSMA) (2022)</subsection>
      <subsection title="Military - note">the military has mutinied several times since the late 1990s,
most recently in 2017, and has had a large role in the country’s
political turmoil; the FACI's operational focus is internal
security and the growing threat posed by Islamic militants
associated with the al-Qa’ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM)
terrorist group operating across the border in Burkina Faso; AQIM
militants conducted significant attacks in the country in 2016 and
2020; Côte d’Ivoire since 2016 has stepped up border security and
completed building a joint counter-terrorism training center with
France near Abidjan in 2020

the UN maintained a 9,000-strong peacekeeping force in Cote
d’Ivoire (UNOCI) from 2004 until 2017 (2022)</subsection>
      <subsection title="Maritime threats">the International Maritime Bureau reports the territorial and
offshore waters in the Niger Delta and Gulf of Guinea remain a very
high risk for piracy and armed robbery of ships; in 2021, there
were 34 reported incidents of piracy and armed robbery at sea in
the Gulf of Guinea region; although a significant decrease from the
total number of 81 incidents in 2020, it included the one hijacking
and three of five ships fired upon worldwide; while boarding and
attempted boarding to steal valuables from ships and crews are the
most common types of incidents, almost a third of all incidents
involve a hijacking and/or kidnapping; in 2021, 57 crew members
were kidnapped in seven separate incidents in the Gulf of Guinea,
representing 100% of kidnappings worldwide; Nigerian pirates in
particular are well armed and very aggressive, operating as far as
200 nm offshore; the Maritime Administration of the US Department
of Transportation has issued a Maritime Advisory (2022-001 - Gulf
of Guinea-Piracy/Armed Robbery/Kidnapping for Ransom) effective 4
January 2022, which states in part, "Piracy, armed robbery, and
kidnapping for ransom continue to serve as significant threats to
US-flagged vessels transiting or operating in the Gulf of
Guinea"</subsection>
