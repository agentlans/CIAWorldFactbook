   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">American sailor John HEARD discovered Heard Island in 1853 and
thought it was a glacier that had broken away from Antarctica.
Fellow American William MCDONALD discovered the McDonald Islands
the following year. Starting in 1855, sealers lived on the islands
harvesting elephant seal oil; by the time the practice was ended in
1877, most of the islands’ seals were killed. The UK formally
claimed the islands in 1910 and Australian explorer Douglas MAWSON
visited Heard Island in 1929. In 1947, the UK transferred the
islands to Australia for its Antarctica research, but Australia
closed the research station on Heard Island in 1954 when it opened
a new research station on the Antarctic continent. McDonald Island
has been an active volcano since it emerged from dormancy in 1992,
and the island doubled in size after an eruption in 1996. In 1997,
the islands were named a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Populated by a
large number of bird species, seals, and penguins, the islands are
primarily used for research with limited fishing being permitted in
the surrounding waters.

(at 2,745 meters, it is taller than Mt. Kosciuszko in Australia
proper), and one of only two active volcanoes located in Australian
territory, the other being McDonald Island; in 1992, McDonald
Island broke its dormancy and began erupting; it has erupted
several times since, most recently in 2005</subsection>
