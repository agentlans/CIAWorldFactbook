   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Multiple waves of Bantu-speaking groups moved into and through
what is now Zambia over the past thousand years. In the 1880s, the
British began securing mineral and other economic concessions from
various local leaders and the territory that is now Zambia
eventually came under the control of the former British South
Africa Company and was incorporated as the protectorate of Northern
Rhodesia in 1911. Administrative control was taken over by the UK
in 1924. During the 1920s and 1930s, advances in mining spurred
development and immigration.

The name was changed to Zambia upon independence in 1964. In the
1980s and 1990s, declining copper prices, economic mismanagement,
and a prolonged drought hurt the economy. Elections in 1991 brought
an end to one-party rule and propelled the Movement for Multiparty
Democracy (MMD) into power. The subsequent vote in 1996, however,
saw increasing harassment of opposition parties and abuse of state
media and other resources. The election in 2001 was marked by
administrative problems, with three parties filing a legal petition
challenging the election of ruling party candidate Levy MWANAWASA.
MWANAWASA was reelected in 2006 in an election that was deemed free
and fair. Upon his death in August 2008, he was succeeded by his
vice president, Rupiah BANDA, who won a special presidential
byelection later that year. The MMD and BANDA lost to the Patriotic
Front (PF) and Michael SATA in the 2011 general elections. SATA,
however, presided over a period of haphazard economic management
and attempted to silence opposition to PF policies. SATA died in
October 2014 and was succeeded by his vice president, Guy SCOTT,
who served as interim president until January 2015, when Edgar
LUNGU won the presidential byelection and completed SATA's term.
LUNGU then won a full term in August 2016 presidential elections.
Hakainde HICHILEMA was elected president in August 2021.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Zambia’s poor, youthful population consists primarily of
Bantu-speaking people representing nearly 70 different ethnicities.
Zambia’s high fertility rate continues to drive rapid population
growth, averaging almost 3% annually between 2000 and 2010, and
reaching over 3.3% in 2022. The country’s total fertility rate has
fallen by less than 1.5 children per woman during the last 30 years
and still averages among the world’s highest, almost 6 children per
woman, largely because of the country’s lack of access to family
planning services, education for girls, and employment for women.
Zambia also exhibits wide fertility disparities based on rural or
urban location, education, and income. Poor, uneducated women from
rural areas are more likely to marry young, to give birth early,
and to have more children, viewing children as a sign of prestige
and recognizing that not all of their children will live to
adulthood. HIV/AIDS is prevalent in Zambia and contributes to its
low life expectancy.Zambian emigration is low compared to many other African
countries and is comprised predominantly of the well-educated. The
small amount of brain drain, however, has a major impact in Zambia
because of its limited human capital and lack of educational
infrastructure for developing skilled professionals in key fields.
For example, Zambia has few schools for training doctors, nurses,
and other health care workers. Its spending on education is low
compared to other Sub-Saharan countries.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">following elections held in August 2021, the new government immediately established a Ministry of Technology and Science to promote the use of ICT in developing economic growth and social inclusion; this focus on ICT, and on telecoms in particular, has been central to government strategies for some years; as part of the Smart Zambia initiative, investment has been made in data centers, a computer assembly plant, ICT training centers, and a Smart Education program; these efforts have been combined with the extension of broadband access and improved connectivity to international submarine cables; in turn, this has resulted in a considerable reduction in fixed-line and mobile access pricing for end-users; mobile network operators continue to invest in 3G and LTE-based services, the government contracted to upgrade the state-owned mobile infrastructure for 5G services; delays in holding spectrum have stymied the development of 5G thus far; in mid-2021 the regulator completed a consultation of auctioning low, medium, and high band spectrum for 5G, aiming to provide sufficient spectrum to meet the anticipated increase in data traffic in coming years; fixed-line broadband services remain underdeveloped (2022)</note>
         <note title="domestic">fiber optic connections are available between most larger towns and cities with microwave radio relays serving more rural areas; 3G and LTE with FttX in limited urban areas and private Ku or Ka band VSAT terminals in remote locations; fixed-line teledensity less than 1 per 100 and mobile-cellular roughly 104 per 100 (2020)</note>
         <note title="international">country code - 260; multiple providers operate overland fiber optic routes via Zimbabwe/South Africa, Botswana/Namibia and Tanzania provide access to the major undersea cables</note>
         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>

the left bank (Zambian side) of the Cuando/Kwando River do not
conform with the physical alignment of the unstable
shoreline, Zambian residents in some areas have settled
illegally on sections of shoreline that fall on the Angolan side of
the boundary

Zambia-Democratic Republic of Congo(DRC): boundary commission
continues discussions over Congolese-administered triangle of land
on the right bank of the Lunkinda River claimed by Zambia near the
DRC village of PwetoZambia-Tanzania: some drug smuggling may take place
across the Zambia-Tanzania border; there are no known current
territorial issues, as both states have continued to recognize the
colonial boundaries last modified in 1937; the boundary in Lake
Tanganyika remains undefined.

Zambia-Zimbabwe: in 2004, Zimbabwe dropped objections to
plans between Botswana and Zambia to build a bridge over the
Zambezi River, thereby de facto recognizing a short, but not
clearly delimited, Botswana-Zambia boundary in the river; in May
2021, Botswana and Zambia agreed in principle to let Zimbabwe be a
partner in the bridge project as it enters its lasts phase</subsection>

         <note title="tier rating">Tier 2 Watch List — Zambia does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking but is making efforts to do so; efforts included increasing law enforcement training, establishing two fast-track human trafficking courts, conducting awareness campaigns about human trafficking, slightly increasing prosecutions and convictions, and strengthening prison sentences given to traffickers; however; investigations of trafficking crimes and funding to shelters and other victim assistance programs decreased; authorities did not proactively screen for trafficking among vulnerable populations, including foreign nationals and those involved in commercial sex; authorities detained and deported potential trafficking victims involved in smuggling; the national inter-ministerial committee is weak in overseeing national anti-trafficking efforts and trends (2020)</note>
         <note title="trafficking profile">human traffickers exploit domestic and foreign victims in Zambia and Zambians abroad; most trafficking occurs within Zambia’s borders, with traffickers exploiting women and children from rural areas in cities in domestic servitude or forced labor in agriculture, textile production, mining, construction, small businesses, such as bakeries, and forced begging; Jerabo gangs force Zambian children into illegal mining operations, such as loading stolen copper or crushing rocks; truck drivers exploit Zambian boys and girls in sex trafficking in towns along the Zimbabwean and Tanzanian borders, and miners exploit them in Solwezi; Zambian boys are exploited for sex trafficking in Zimbabwe and women and girls in South Africa; traffickers exploit victims from Tanzania and Malawi in the Zambian timber industry</note>
