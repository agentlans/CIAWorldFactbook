   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The first recorded kingdom (Choson) on the Korean Peninsula
dates from approximately 2300 B.C. Over the subsequent centuries,
three main kingdoms - Kogoryo, Paekche, and Silla - were
established on the Peninsula.  By the 5th century
A.D., Kogoryo emerged as the most powerful, with control over much
of the Peninsula, as well as part of Manchuria (modern-day
northeast China).  However, Silla allied with the Chinese to
create the first unified Korean state in the late 7th
century (688).  Following the collapse of Silla in the
9th century, Korea was unified under the Koryo (Goryeo;
918-1392) and the Chosen (Joseon; 1392-1910) dynasties.Korea became the object of intense imperialistic rivalry between
the Chinese (its traditional benefactor), Japanese, and Russian
empires in the latter half of the 19th and early 20th
centuries. Following the Sino-Japanese War (1894-95) and the
Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), Korea was occupied by Imperial
Japan. In 1910, Tokyo formally annexed the entire Peninsula. Korea
regained its independence following Japan's surrender to the US and
its allies in 1945. After World War II, a democratic government
(Republic of Korea, ROK) was set up in the southern half of the
Korean Peninsula while a communist-style government was installed
in the north (North Korea; aka Democratic People's Republic of
Korea, DPRK). During the Korean War (1950-53), US troops and UN
forces fought alongside ROK soldiers to defend South Korea from a
North Korean invasion supported by communist China and the Soviet
Union. A 1953 armistice split the Peninsula along a demilitarized
zone at about the 38th parallel.

Syngman RHEE led the country as its first president from 1948-1960.
PARK Chung-hee took over leadership of the country in a 1961 coup.
During his regime from 1961 to 1979, South Korea achieved rapid
economic growth, with per capita income rising to roughly 17 times
the level of North Korea in 1979. PARK was assassinated in 1979,
and subsequent years were marked by political turmoil and continued
authoritarian rule as the country's pro-democracy movement grew.
South Korea held its first free presidential election under a
revised democratic constitution in 1987, with former South Korean
Army general ROH Tae-woo winning a close race. In 1993, KIM
Young-sam (1993-98) became the first civilian president of South
Korea's new democratic era. President KIM Dae-jung (1998-2003) won
the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for his contributions to South Korean
democracy and his "Sunshine Policy" of engagement with North Korea.
President PARK Geun-hye, daughter of former South Korean President
PARK Chung-hee, took office in February 2013 as South Korea's first
female leader. In December 2016, the National Assembly passed an
impeachment motion against President PARK over her alleged
involvement in a corruption and influence-peddling scandal,
immediately suspending her presidential authorities. The
impeachment was upheld in March 2017, triggering an early
presidential election in May 2017 won by MOON Jae-in.Discord and tensions with North Korea, punctuated by North
Korean military provocations, missile launches, and nuclear tests,
have permeated inter-Korean relations for much of the past decade.
Despite a period of respite in 2018-2019 ushered in by North
Korea's participation in the 2018 Winter Olympic and Paralympic
Games in South Korea and high-level diplomatic meetings, including
historic US-North Korea summits, relations were stagnant through
2022. </subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">South Korea is second only to Hong Kong in the world rankings of telecom market maturity; it is also on the leading edge of the latest telecom technology developments, including around 6G; with its highly urbanized, tech-savvy population, South Korea also enjoys very high communication levels across all segments – fixed-line telephony (44% at the start of 2022), fixed broadband (46%), mobile voice and data (144%), and mobile broadband (120%); the performance of the mobile sector is on a par with other developed markets around the region, but it’s the wire line segment that allows South Korea to stand out from the crowd; this is partly a reflection of the large proportion of its population who live in apartment buildings (around 60%), making fiber and apartment LAN connections relatively easy and cost-effective to deploy; the government’s Ultra Broadband convergence Network (UBcN) had aimed to reach 50% adoption by the end of 2022, but that target may be a few more years away; fixed-line teledensity is also at a very high level compared to most of the rest of the world, but it has been on a sharp decline from a rate of 60% ten years ago; on the mobile front, users have enthusiastically migrated from one generation of mobile platform to the next as each iteration becomes available; there also doesn’t appear to be any great concern about there being a lack of demand for 5G in South Korea (when the country is already well supported by 4G networks), with 30% of all subscribers having already made the switch; part of the reason behind the rapid transition may be the subsidized handsets on offer from each of the MNOs and the MVNOs (2022)</note>
         <note title="domestic">fixed-line approximately 47 per 100 and mobile-cellular services 134 per 100 persons; rapid assimilation of a full range of telecommunications technologies leading to a boom in e-commerce (2020)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>

      <subsection title="Military - note">the 1953 US-South Korea Mutual Defense Treaty is a cornerstone
of South Korea’s security; the Treaty committed the US to provide
assistance in the event of an attack, particularly from North
Korea; in addition, the Treaty gave the US permission to station
land, air, and sea forces in and about the territory of South Korea
as determined by mutual agreement; as of 2022, the US maintained
approximately 28,000 military personnel in the countrythe South Korean military has assisted the US in conflicts in
Afghanistan (5,000 troops; 2001-2014), Iraq (20,000 troops;
2003-2008), and Vietnam (325,000 troops; 1964-1973)

South Korea has Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA) status with the US; MNNA
is a designation under US law that provides foreign partners with
certain benefits in the areas of defense trade and security
cooperation; while MNNA status provides military and economic
privileges, it does not entail any security commitments

in 2016, South Korea concluded an agreement with the EU for
participation in EU Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP)
missions and operations, such as the EU Naval Force Somalia –
Operation Atalanta, which protects maritime shipping and conducts
counter-piracy operations off the coast of East AfricaSouth Korea has been engaged with NATO through dialogue and
security cooperation since 2005 and is considered by NATO to be a
global partner; it has participated in NATO-led missions and
exercises, including leading an integrated civilian-military
reconstruction team in Afghanistan as part of the
NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, 2010-2013;
it has also cooperated with NATO in countering the threat of piracy
in the Gulf of Aden by providing naval vessels as escortsin addition to the invasion of South Korea and the subsequent
Korean War (1950-53), North Korea from the 1960s to the 1980s
launched a considerable number of limited military and subversive
actions against South Korea using special forces and terrorist
tactics; including aggressive skirmishes along the DMZ, overt
attempts to assassinate South Korean leaders, kidnappings, the
bombing of an airliner, and a failed effort in 1968 to foment an
insurrection and conduct a guerrilla war in the South with more
than 100 seaborne commandos; from the 1990s until 2010, the North
lost two submarines and a semi-submersible boat attempting to
insert infiltrators into the South (1996, 1998) and provoked
several engagements in the Northwest Islands area along the
disputed Northern Limit Line (NLL), including naval skirmishes
between patrol boats in 1999 and 2002, the torpedoing and sinking
of a South Korean corvette, the Cheonan, in 2010, and the
bombardment of a South Korean Marine Corps installation on
Yeonpyeong Island, also in 2010; since 2010, further minor
incidents continue to occur periodically along the DMZ, where both
the North and the South Korean militaries maintain large numbers of
troops

in 2018, North Korea and South Korea signed a tension reduction
agreement known as the Comprehensive Military Agreement (CMA),
which established land, sea, and air buffer zones along the DMZ and
the NLL; implementation of the CMA required the removal of some
land mines and guard posts; the efforts led to a reduction of
tension in the DMZ, but as of 2022 North Korea had failed to uphold
much of its side of the agreement</subsection>
