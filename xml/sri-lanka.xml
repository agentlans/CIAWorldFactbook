   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The first Sinhalese arrived in Sri Lanka late in the 6th century
B.C., probably from northern India. Buddhism was introduced circa
250 B.C., and the first kingdoms developed at the cities of
Anuradhapura (from circa 200 B.C. to circa A.D. 1000) and
Polonnaruwa (from about 1070 to 1200). In the 14th century, a south
Indian dynasty established a Tamil kingdom in northern Sri Lanka.
The Portuguese controlled the coastal areas of the island in the
16th century followed by the Dutch in the 17th century. The island
was ceded to the British in 1796, became a crown colony in 1802,
and was formally united under British rule by 1815. As Ceylon, it
became independent in 1948; its name was changed to Sri Lanka in
1972. Prevailing tensions between the Sinhalese majority and Tamil
separatists erupted into war in July 1983. Fighting between the
government and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) continued
for over a quarter century. Although Norway brokered peace
negotiations that led to a cease-fire in 2002, the fighting slowly
resumed and was again in full force by 2006. The government
defeated the LTTE in May 2009.During the post-conflict years under President Mahinda
RAJAPAKSA, the government initiated infrastructure development
projects, many of which were financed by loans from China. His
regime faced significant allegations of human rights violations and
a shrinking democratic space for civil society.  In 2015, a
new coalition government headed by President Maithripala SIRISENA
of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and Prime Minister Ranil
WICKREMESINGHE of the United National Party came to power with
pledges to advance economic, governance, anti-corruption,
reconciliation, justice, and accountability reforms. However,
implementation of these reforms has been uneven. In October 2018,
President SIRISENA attempted to oust Prime Minister WICKREMESINGHE,
swearing in former President RAJAPAKSA as the new prime minister
and issuing an order to dissolve the Parliament and hold elections.
This sparked a seven-week constitutional crisis that ended when the
Supreme Court ruled SIRISENA’s actions unconstitutional, RAJAPAKSA
resigned, and WICKREMESINGHE was reinstated. In November 2019,
Gotabaya RAJAPAKSA won the presidential election and appointed his
brother, Mahinda, prime minister. Since Gotabaya RAJAPAKSA’s
election, there have been concerns about his administration’s
commitment to pursuing justice, human rights, and accountability
reforms, as well as the risks to foreign creditors that Sri Lanka
faces given its ongoing economic crisis. A combination of factors
including the impact of the worldwide COVID pandemic; severe
shortages of food, medicine, and fuel; and power outages have
triggered increasingly violent protests in Columbo. Longtime
parliamentarian and former five-time prime minister, Ranil
WICKREMESINGHE replaced Mahinda RAJAPASKA as prime-minister in
mid-May 2022, with a mandate to resolve the country's economic
problems.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Sri Lanka’s fixed-line
telephony market was one of the very few in the world to experience
a significant upsurge in subscriptions in 2020; while the country
suffers from a relatively poor fixed-line infrastructure and a
correspondingly strong mobile sector, demand for traditional phone
services increased 14% in 2020; preliminary results suggest a
further jump of up to 13% can also be expected in 2021; this will
take Sri Lanka’s fixed-line penetration to levels not seen since
2013; the most reason behind the market’s reversal of fortunes is
the Covid-19 crisis and Sri Lanka’s ensuring lock downs; these
forced much of the population back inside and reverting to
‘traditional’ methods of communication for both voice and data
services; the fixed broadband market was equally robust, growing
20% in 2020 alone; Sri Lanka possesses a relatively low number of
computers per household so the fixed broadband market’s success
comes off a small base; the one area of the telecommunications
market that experienced a fall was the mobile segment; up until the
start of the pandemic, Sri Lanka had a very high mobile penetration
rate of 155%; this near-saturation level reflected the
preponderance for subscribers to carry multiple SIM cards to take
advantage of cheaper on-net call rates; the reduction in demand and
traffic because of the pandemic led to a sharp drop in the number
of active subscriptions, down to just 135% – a 17% decline in just
one year; the market is expected to bounce back quickly, as soon as
the country eases back on its lock down measures and reduces travel
restrictions; it will also be boosted, come 2022, by the
anticipated launch of commercial 5G mobile services (2021)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line roughly 11 per 100 and
mobile-cellular nearly 139 per 100; national trunk network consists
of digital microwave radio relay and fiber-optic links; fixed
wireless local loops have been installed; competition is strong in
mobile cellular systems and mobile cellular subscribership is
increasing (2020)<br/>

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

      <subsection title="Military - note">Sri Lanka traditionally has had close security ties to India;
India participated in the counter-insurgency war against the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) from 1987-1991, losing over
1,000 soldiers in the conflict; the Sri Lankan and Indian
militaries continue to conduct exercises together, and India trains
over 1,000 Sri Lankan soldiers per year; however, since the end of
the war with LTTE, Sri Lanka has also increased military ties with
China, including acquiring military equipment, hosting naval port
calls, and sending personnel to China for training<br/>
         <br/>
since the end of the war with LTTE, the Sri Lankan military has
increased its role in a range of commercial sectors including
agriculture, hotels, leisure, and restaurants; this expansion has
been particularly discernible in the majority Tamil-populated
northern and eastern provinces where a large portion of the Army
reportedly remained deployed as of 2021 (2022)</subsection>
