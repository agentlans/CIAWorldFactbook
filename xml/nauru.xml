   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Nauru was inhabited by Micronesian and Polynesian settlers by
around 1000 B.C., and the island was divided into 12 clans. Nauru
developed in relative isolation because ocean currents made
landfall on the island difficult. As a result, the Nauruan language
does not clearly resemble any other in the Pacific region. In 1798,
British sea captain John FEARN became the first European to spot
the island. By 1830, European whalers used Nauru as a supply stop,
trading firearms for food. In 1878, a civil war erupted on the
island, reducing the population by more than a third. Germany
forcibly annexed Nauru in 1888 by holding the 12 chiefs under house
arrest until they consented to the annexation. Germany banned
alcohol, confiscated weapons, instituted strict dress codes, and
brought in Christian missionaries to convert the population.
Phosphate was discovered in 1900 and heavily mined, although Nauru
and Nauruans earned about one tenth of one percent of the profits
from the phosphate deposits.

Australian forces captured Nauru from Germany during World War I,
and in 1919, it was placed under a joint Australian-British-New
Zealand mandate with Australian administration. Japan occupied
Nauru during World War II and used its residents as forced labor
elsewhere in the Pacific while destroying much of the
infrastructure on the island. After the war, Nauru became a UN
trust territory under Australian administration. Recognizing the
phosphate stocks would eventually be depleted, in 1962, Australian
Prime Minister Robert MENZIES offered to resettle all Nauruans on
Curtis Island in Queensland, but Nauruans rejected that plan and
opted for independence, which was achieved in 1968. In 1970, Nauru
purchased the phosphate mining assets, and income from the mines
made Nauruans among the richest people in the world. However, Nauru
subsequently began a series of unwise investments in buildings,
musical theater, and an airline. Nauru sued Australia in 1989 for
the damage caused by mining when Australia administered the island.
Widespread phosphate mining officially ceased in 2006.

Nauru went nearly bankrupt by 2000 and tried to rebrand itself as
an offshore banking haven, although it ended that practice in 2005.
In 2001, Australia set up the Nauru Regional Processing Center
(NRPC), an offshore refugee detention facility, paying Nauru per
person at the center. The NRPC was closed in 2008 but reopened in
2012. The number of refugees has steadily declined since 2014, and
the remaining people were moved to a hotel in Brisbane, Australia,
in 2020, effectively shuttering the NRPC. In a bid for Russian
humanitarian aid, in 2008, Nauru recognized the breakaway Georgian
republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.</subsection>
