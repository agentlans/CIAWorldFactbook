   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The uninhabited islands were discovered and colonized by the
Portuguese in the 15th century; Cabo Verde subsequently became a
trading center for African slaves and later an important coaling
and resupply stop for whaling and transatlantic shipping. The
fusing of European and various African cultural traditions is
reflected in Cabo Verde’s Krioulo language, music, and pano
textiles. Following independence in 1975, and a tentative interest
in unification with Guinea-Bissau, a one-party system was
established and maintained until multi-party elections were held in
1990. Cabo Verde continues to sustain one of Africa's most stable
democratic governments and one of its most stable economies,
maintaining a currency formerly pegged to the Portuguese escudo and
then the euro since 1998. Repeated droughts during the second half
of the 20th century caused significant hardship and prompted heavy
emigration. As a result, Cabo Verde's expatriate population -
concentrated in Boston and Western Europe - is greater than its
domestic one.

Most Cabo Verdeans have both African and Portuguese antecedents.
Cabo Verde’s population descends from its first permanent
inhabitants in the late 15th-century – a preponderance of West
African slaves, a small share of Portuguese colonists, and even
fewer Italians and Spaniards. Among the nine inhabited islands,
population distribution is variable. Islands in the east are very
dry and are home to the country's growing tourism industry. The
more western islands receive more precipitation and support larger
populations, but agriculture and livestock grazing have damaged
their soil fertility and vegetation. For centuries, the country’s
overall population size has fluctuated significantly, as recurring
periods of famine and epidemics have caused high death tolls and
emigration. In November 2021, Jose Maria NEVES was sworn in as Cabo
Verde's latest president.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Cabo Verde’s population descends from its first permanent
inhabitants in the late 15th-century – a preponderance of West
African slaves, a small share of Portuguese colonists, and even
fewer Italians, Spaniards, and Portuguese Jews. Over the centuries,
the country’s overall population size has fluctuated significantly,
as recurring periods of famine and epidemics have caused high death
tolls and emigration.Labor migration historically reduced Cabo Verde’s population
growth and still provides a key source of income through
remittances. Expatriates probably outnumber Cabo Verde’s resident
population, with most families having a member abroad. Cabo
Verdeans have settled in the US, Europe, Africa, and South America.
The largest diaspora community in New Bedford, Massachusetts,
dating to the early 1800s, is a byproduct of the transatlantic
whaling industry. Cabo Verdean men fleeing poverty at home joined
the crews of US whaling ships that stopped in the islands. Many
settled in New Bedford and stayed in the whaling or shipping trade,
worked in the textile or cranberry industries, or operated their
own transatlantic packet ships that transported compatriots to the
US. Increased Cabo Verdean emigration to the US coincided with the
gradual and eventually complete abolition of slavery in the
archipelago in 1878.During the same period, Portuguese authorities coerced Cabo
Verdeans to go to Sao Tome and Principe and other Portuguese
colonies in Africa to work as indentured laborers on plantations.
In the 1920s, when the US implemented immigration quotas, Cabo
Verdean emigration shifted toward Portugal, West Africa (Senegal),
and South America (Argentina). Growing numbers of Cabo Verdean
labor migrants headed to Western Europe in the 1960s and 1970s.
They filled unskilled jobs in Portugal, as many Portuguese sought
out work opportunities in the more prosperous economies of
northwest Europe. Cabo Verdeans eventually expanded their
emigration to the Netherlands, where they worked in the shipping
industry. Migration to the US resumed under relaxed migration laws.
Cabo Verdean women also began migrating to southern Europe to
become domestic workers, a trend that continues today and has
shifted the gender balance of Cabo Verdean emigration.Emigration has declined in more recent decades due to the
adoption of more restrictive migration policies in destination
countries. Reduced emigration along with a large youth population,
decreased mortality rates, and increased life expectancies, has
boosted population growth, putting further pressure on domestic
employment and resources. In addition, Cabo Verde has attracted
increasing numbers of migrants in recent decades, consisting
primarily of people from West Africa, Portuguese-speaking African
countries, Portugal, and China. Since the 1990s, some West African
migrants have used Cabo Verde as a stepping stone for illegal
migration to Europe.</subsection>
