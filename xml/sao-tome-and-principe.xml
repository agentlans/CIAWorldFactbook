   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Portugal discovered and colonized the uninhabited islands in the
late 15th century, setting up a sugar-based economy that gave way
to coffee and cocoa in the 19th century - all grown with African
plantation slave labor, a form of which lingered into the 20th
century. While independence was achieved in 1975, democratic
reforms were not instituted until the late 1980s. The country held
its first free elections in 1991, but frequent internal wrangling
between the various political parties precipitated repeated changes
in leadership and four failed, non-violent coup attempts in 1995,
1998, 2003, and 2009. In 2012, three opposition parties combined in
a no confidence vote to bring down the majority government of
former Prime Minister Patrice TROVOADA, but in 2014, legislative
elections returned him to the office. President Evaristo CARVALHO,
of the same political party as Prime Minister TROVOADA, was elected
in September 2016, marking a rare instance in which the positions
of president and prime minister were held by the same party. Prime
Minister TROVOADA resigned at the end of 2018 and was replaced by
Jorge BOM JESUS. Carlos Vila NOVA was elected president in early
September 2021 and was inaugurated 2 October 2021. New oil
discoveries in the Gulf of Guinea may attract increased attention
to the small island nation.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Sao Tome and Principe’s youthful age structure – more than 60%
of the population is under the age of 25 as of 2020 – and high
fertility rate ensure future population growth. Although Sao Tome
has a net negative international migration rate, emigration is not
a sufficient safety valve to reduce already high levels of
unemployment and poverty. While literacy and primary school
attendance have improved in recent years, Sao Tome still struggles
to improve its educational quality and to increase its secondary
school completion rate. Despite some improvements in education and
access to healthcare, Sao Tome and Principe has much to do to
decrease its high poverty rate, create jobs, and increase its
economic growth.The population of Sao Tome and Principe descends primarily from
the islands’ colonial Portuguese settlers, who first arrived in the
late 15th century, and the much larger number of African slaves
brought in for sugar production and the slave trade. For about 100
years after the abolition of slavery in 1876, the population was
further shaped by the widespread use of imported unskilled contract
laborers from Portugal’s other African colonies, who worked on
coffee and cocoa plantations. In the first decades after abolition,
most workers were brought from Angola under a system similar to
slavery. While Angolan laborers were technically free, they were
forced or coerced into long contracts that were automatically
renewed and extended to their children. Other contract workers from
Mozambique and famine-stricken Cape Verde first arrived in the
early 20th century under short-term contracts and had the option of
repatriation, although some chose to remain in Sao Tome and
Principe.Today’s Sao Tomean population consists of mesticos (creole
descendants of the European immigrants and African slaves that
first inhabited the islands), forros (descendants of freed African
slaves), angolares (descendants of runaway African slaves that
formed a community in the south of Sao Tome Island and today are
fishermen), servicais (contract laborers from Angola, Mozambique,
and Cape Verde), tongas (locally born children of contract
laborers), and lesser numbers of Europeans and Asians.</subsection>

total number of 81 incidents in 2020, it included the one hijacking
and three of five ships fired upon worldwide; while boarding and
attempted boarding to steal valuables from ships and crews are the
most common types of incidents, almost a third of all incidents
involve a hijacking and/or kidnapping; in 2021, 57 crew members
were kidnapped in seven separate incidents in the Gulf of Guinea,
representing 100% of kidnappings worldwide; Nigerian pirates in
particular are well armed and very aggressive, operating as far as
200 nm offshore; the Maritime Administration of the US Department
of Transportation has issued a Maritime Advisory (2022-001 - Gulf
of Guinea-Piracy/Armed Robbery/Kidnapping for Ransom) effective 4
