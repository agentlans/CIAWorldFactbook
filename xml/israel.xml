   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Israel has emerged as a regional economic and military
powerhouse, leveraging its booming high-tech sector, massive
defense industry, and concerns about Iran to foster partnerships
around the world. The State of Israel was established in 1948. The
UN General Assembly had proposed to partition the British Mandate
for Palestine into an Arab and Jewish state. Arab states rejected
the UN plan and were subsequently defeated militarily in the 1948
war that followed the withdrawal of the British on 14 May 1948.
Israel was admitted as a member of the UN in 1949 and saw rapid
population growth, primarily due to migration from Europe and the
Middle East, over the following years. Israel and its Arab
neighbors fought wars in 1967 and 1973 and Israel signed peace
treaties with Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994. Israel took control
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the course of the 1967 war, and
subsequently administered those territories through military
authorities. Israel and Palestinian officials signed interim
agreements in the 1990s that created an interim period of
Palestinian self-rule in parts of the West Bank and Gaza. Israel
withdrew from Gaza in 2005. While the most recent formal efforts
between Israel and the Palestinian Authority to negotiate final
status issues occurred in 2013-2014, the US continues its efforts
to advance peace. Immigration to Israel continues, with more than
20,000 new immigrants, mostly Jewish, in 2020.

The Israeli economy has undergone a dramatic transformation in the
last 25 years, led by cutting-edge, high-tech sectors. Offshore gas
discoveries in the Mediterranean, most notably in the Tamar and
Leviathan gasfields, place Israel at the center of a potential
regional natural gas market. However, longer-term structural issues
such as low labor force participation among minority populations,
low workforce productivity, high costs for housing and consumer
staples, and a lack of competition, remain a concern for many
Israelis and an important consideration for Israeli politicians.
Former Prime Minister Benjamin NETANYAHU dominated Israel's
political landscape from 2009 to June 2021, becoming Israel's
longest serving prime minister before he was unseated by Naftali
BENNETT, after Israel's fourth election in two years. BENNETT
formed the most ideologically diverse coalition in Israel's
history, including the participation of an Arab-Israeli party. He
served as prime minister for a year before stepping down on 1 July
2022 in favor of Yair LAPID, who was in office for only six months
before himself being succeeded by Benjamin NETANYAHU in late 2022.
Israel signed normalization agreements – brokered by the US – with
Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and Morocco in late 2020 and
reached an agreement with Sudan in early 2021.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Military equipment inventories and acquisitions">the majority of the IDF's inventory is comprised of weapons that
are domestically produced or imported from Europe and the US; the
US has been the leading supplier of arms; Israel has a broad
defense industrial base that can develop, produce, support, and
sustain a wide variety of weapons systems for both domestic use and
export, particularly armored vehicles, unmanned aerial systems, air
defense, and guided missiles (2022)</subsection>

      <subsection title="Military - note">the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) has
operated in the Golan between Israel and Syria since 1974 to
monitor the ceasefire following the 1973 Arab-Israeli War and
supervise the areas of separation between the two countries; as of
2022, UNDOF consisted of about 1,000 military personnel

since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011, Israel has
routinely carried out air strikes in Syria targeting Iranian,
Iranian-backed militia and Hizballah forces, and some Syrian
Government military positions; over the same period, the IDF has
carried out numerous strikes against Hizballah in Lebanon in
response to attacks on Israeli territory; Israel fought a
month-long war in Lebanon with Hizballah in 2006 (see Appendix
T for details on Hizballah)

as of 2022, the IDF also conducted frequent operations against the
HAMAS and Palestine Islamic Jihad (PIJ) terrorist groups operating
out of the Gaza Strip; since seizing control of the Gaza Strip in
2007, HAMAS has claimed responsibility for numerous rocket attacks
into Israel and organized protests at the border between Gaza and
Israel, resulting in violent clashes, casualties, and reprisal
military actions by the IDF; HAMAS and Israel fought an 11-day
conflict in May of 2021, which ended in an informal truce; sporadic
clashes continued into 2022, including incendiary balloon attacks
from Palestinian territory and retaliatory IDF strikes; PIJ has
conducted numerous attacks on Israel since the 1980s, including a
barrage of mortar and rocket strikes in February 2020 (see Appendix-T for more details on HAMAS and
Palestine Islamic Jihad)

Israel has Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA) status with the US; MNNA is a
designation under US law that provides foreign partners with
certain benefits in the areas of defense trade and security
cooperation; while MNNA status provides military and economic
privileges, it does not entail any security commitments (2022)</subsection>
