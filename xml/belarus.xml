   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">After seven decades as a constituent republic of the USSR,
Belarus attained its independence in 1991. It has retained closer
political and economic ties to Russia than have any of the other
former Soviet republics. Belarus and Russia signed a treaty on a
two-state union on 8 December 1999 envisioning greater political
and economic integration. Although Belarus agreed to a framework to
carry out the accord, serious implementation has yet to take place
and current negotiations on further integration have been
contentious. Since his election in July 1994 as the country's first
and only directly elected president, Alyaksandr LUKASHENKA has
steadily consolidated his power through authoritarian means and a
centralized economic system. Government restrictions on political
and civil freedoms, freedom of speech and the press, peaceful
assembly, and religion have remained in place. Restrictions on
political freedoms have grown increasingly strained following the
disputed presidential election in August 2020. The election results
sparked largescale protests as members of the opposition and civil
society criticized the election’s validity. Alyaksandr LUKASHENKA
has remained in power as the disputed winner of the presidential
election after quelling protests in late 2020.    </subsection>
