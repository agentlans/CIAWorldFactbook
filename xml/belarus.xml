   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">After seven decades as a constituent republic of the USSR,
Belarus attained its independence in 1991. It has retained closer
political and economic ties to Russia than have any of the other
former Soviet republics. Belarus and Russia signed a treaty on a
two-state union on 8 December 1999 envisioning greater political
and economic integration. Although Belarus agreed to a framework to
carry out the accord, serious implementation has yet to take place
and current negotiations on further integration have been
contentious. Since his election in July 1994 as the country's first
and only directly elected president, Alyaksandr LUKASHENKA has
steadily consolidated his power through authoritarian means and a
centralized economic system. Government restrictions on political
and civil freedoms, freedom of speech and the press, peaceful
assembly, and religion have remained in place. Restrictions on
political freedoms have grown increasingly strained following the
disputed presidential election in August 2020. The election results
sparked largescale protests as members of the opposition and civil
society criticized the election’s validity. Alyaksandr LUKASHENKA
has remained in power as the disputed winner of the presidential
election after quelling protests in late 2020.    </subsection>

has successfully promoted the migration to an all-IP platform as
part of a wider effort towards a digital transformation for the
economy; the state-supported infrastructure operator beCloud has
built an extensive fiber network, which reaches all but the
smallest settlements in the country; Belarus has the second-highest
fiber subscription rate in Europe, behind only Iceland; LTE
coverage is almost universal, while considerable progress has also
been made in developing 5G services (2021)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line teledensity is improving
although rural areas continue to be underserved, approximately 45
per 100 fixed-line; mobile-cellular teledensity now roughly 123
telephones per 100 persons (2021)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 375; Belarus is
landlocked and therefore a member of the Trans-European Line (TEL),
Trans-Asia-Europe (TAE) fiber-optic line, and has access to the
Trans-Siberia Line (TSL); 3 fiber-optic segments provide
connectivity to Latvia, Poland, Russia, and Ukraine; worldwide
service is available to Belarus through this infrastructure;
additional analog lines to Russia; Intelsat, Eutelsat, and
Intersputnik earth stations; almost 31,000 base stations in service
in 2019 (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

      <subsection title="Military and security service personnel strengths">approximately 45,000 active duty troops; information on the
individual services varies, but reportedly includes about 25,000
Army, 15,000 Air/Air Defense, and 5,000 Special Operations forces
(2022)</subsection>
      <subsection title="Military equipment inventories and acquisitions">the military's inventory is comprised mostly of
Russian/Soviet-origin equipment, and in recent years Russia has
continued to be the leading provider of arms; Belarus's defense
industry manufactures some equipment (mostly modernized Soviet
designs), including vehicles, guided weapons, and electronic
warfare systems (2022)</subsection>
      <subsection title="Military service age and obligation">18-27 years of age for compulsory military or alternative
service; conscript service obligation is 12-18 months, depending on
academic qualifications, and 24-36 months for alternative service,
also depending on academic qualifications; 17-year-olds are
eligible to become cadets at military higher education institutes,
where they are classified as military personnel (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
note: conscripts can be assigned to the military,
to the Ministry of Interior as internal or border troops, or to the
Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (alternative service); as
of 2020, conscripts comprised an estimated 40% of the military</subsection>
      <subsection title="Military - note">Belarus has close security ties with Russia, including an
integrated air and missile defense system, joint training
exercises, and the establishment of three joint training centers
since 2020 (1 in Belarus, 2 in Russia); Russia has been the
principal supplier of arms to Belarus, and Belarusian troops
reportedly train on Russian equipment; Russia leases from Belarus a
strategic ballistic missile defense site operated by Russian
Aerospace Forces and a global communications facility for the
Russian Navy; in 2020, the countries signed an agreement allowing
for close security cooperation between the Belarusian Ministry of
Interior and the Russian National Guard, including protecting
public order and key government facilities, and combating extremism
and terrorism; in 2022, Belarus allowed Russian military forces to
stage on its territory for its invasion of Ukraine<br/>
         <br/>
Belarus has been a member of the Collective Security Treaty
Organization (CSTO) since 1994 and contributes an airborne brigade

Belarus-Lithuania: Boundary demarcated with
Lithuania.<br/>
         <br/>
Belarus-Poland: As a member state that forms part of the

      <subsection title="Refugees and internally displaced persons">refugees (country of origin): 19,673 (Ukraine)

      <subsection title="Trafficking in persons">tier rating: Tier 3 — Belarus does not fully
meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and
is not making significant efforts to do so, therefore Belarus was
downgraded to Tier 3; nonetheless, the government took some steps
to address trafficking, including conducting investigations and
prosecutions and identifying and referring victims to services;
however, the government did not report investigating, prosecuting,
or convicting traffickers under its trafficking statute nor provide
adequate protection to victims; officials reportedly returned many
migrants and asylum seekers to their countries of origin without
comprehensively screening them for trafficking; the government did
not report conducting awareness activities, and its efforts to
prevent labor trafficking remained inadequate; for the
5th consecutive year, Belarus did not report
investigating or filing charges related to illegal recruitment of
migrant workers (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
trafficking profile: human traffickers exploit
domestic and foreign victims and exploit Belarusians abroad; the
majority of trafficking victims are men subjected to forced labor,
primarily in Russia; most Belarusian victims are trafficked in
Belarus and Russia, but also in Poland, Turkey, and other European,
Eurasian and Middle Eastern countries; some Belarusian women
traveling for foreign employment in the adult entertainment and
hotel industries are subjected to sex trafficking; most traffickers
are Belarusian citizens, and traffickers increasingly use online
methods to coerce victims into forced labor and sex trafficking
(2022)</subsection>
      <subsection title="Illicit drugs">limited cultivation of opium poppy and cannabis, mostly for the
domestic market; transshipment point for illicit drugs to and via
Russia, and to the Baltics and Western Europe; a small and lightly
regulated financial center; anti-money-laundering legislation does
not meet international standards and was weakened further when
know-your-customer requirements were curtailed in 2008; few
investigations or prosecutions of money-laundering activities</subsection>
