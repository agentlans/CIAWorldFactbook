   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">A military power during the 17th century, Sweden has not
participated in any war for two centuries. An armed neutrality was
preserved in both World Wars. Since then, Sweden has pursued a
successful economic formula consisting of a capitalist system
intermixed with substantial welfare elements. Sweden joined the EU
in 1995, but the public rejected the introduction of the euro in a
2003 referendum. The share of Sweden’s population born abroad
increased from 11.3% in 2000 to 20% in 2021. </subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Sweden’s telecom market
includes mature mobile and broadband sectors which have been
stimulated by the progressive investment of the main telcos in
developing new technologies; the country retains one of the best
developed LTE infrastructures in the region, while its MNOs have
benefited from the January 2021 auction of spectrum in the 3.5GHz
band which will enable them to expand services nationally; the
country also has one of the highest fiber broadband penetration
rates in Europe; the focus of FttP is aimed at fulfilling the
government’s target of providing a 1Gb/s service to 98% of the
population by 2025; the methodology to achieve this has rested on
regulatory measures supported by public funds, as well as on the
auction of spectrum in different bands; in the fixed-line broadband
segment, the number of DSL subscribers is falling steadily as
customers continue to migrate to fiber networks; there is also
competition from HFC infrastructure, offering fiber-based broadband
and investing in services based on the DOCSIS3.1 standard; this
report assesses key aspects of the Swedish telecom market,
providing data on fixed network services and profiling the main
players; it also reviews the key regulatory issues, including
interconnection, local loop unbundling, number portability, carrier
preselection and NGN open access; the report also analyses the
mobile market, providing data on network operators and their
strategies in a highly competitive environment; in addition, the
report considers the fixed and fixed-wireless broadband markets,
including analyses of market dynamics and the main operators, as
well as providing subscriber forecasts (2021)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line just over 16 per 100 and
mobile-cellular roughly 128 per 100; coaxial and multiconductor
cables carry most of the voice traffic; parallel microwave radio
relay systems carry some additional telephone channels (2020)<br/>

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
