   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Sultanate of Brunei's influence peaked between the 15th and
17th centuries when its control extended over coastal areas of
northwest Borneo and the southern Philippines. Brunei subsequently
entered a period of decline brought on by internal strife over
royal succession, colonial expansion of European powers, and
piracy. In 1888, Brunei became a British protectorate; independence
was achieved in 1984. The same family has ruled Brunei for over six
centuries. Brunei benefits from extensive petroleum and natural gas
fields, the source of one of the highest per capita GDPs in the
world. In 2017, Brunei celebrated the 50th anniversary of the
Sultan Hassanal BOLKIAH’s accession to the throne.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Brunei is a small, oil-rich sultanate of less than half a
million people, making it the smallest country in Southeast Asia by
population.  Its total fertility rate – the average number of
births per woman – has been steadily declining over the last few
decades, from over 3.5 in the 1980s to below replacement level
today at nearly 1.8.  The trend is due to women’s increased
years of education and participation in the workforce, which have
resulted in later marriages and fewer children.  Yet, the
population continues to grow because of the large number of women
of reproductive age and a reliance on foreign labor – mainly from
Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, and South Asian
countries – to fill low-skilled jobs.Brunei is officially Muslim, and Malay is the official
language.  The country follows an official Malay national
ideology, Malay Islamic Monarchy, which promotes Malay language and
culture, Islamic values, and the monarchy.  Only seven of
Brunei’s native groups are recognized in the constitution and are
defined as “Malay” – Brunei Malays, Belait, Kedayan, Dusun,
Bisayak, Lun Bawang, and Sama-Baiau.  Together they make up
about 66% percent of the population and are referred to as the
Bumiputera.  The Bumiputera are entitled to official
privileges, including land ownership, access to certain types of
employment (Royal Brunei Armed Forces and Brunei Shell Petroleum),
easier access to higher education, and better job opportunities in
the civil service. Brunei’s Chinese population descends from migrants who arrived
when Brunei was a British protectorate (1888 and 1984).  They
are prominent in the non-state commercial sector and account for
approximately 10% of the population.  Most Bruneian Chinese
are permanent residents rather than citizens despite roots going
back several generations.  Many are stateless and are denied
rights granted to citizens, such as land ownership, subsidized
health care, and free secondary and university education. 
Because of the discriminatory policies, the number of Chinese in
Brunei has shrunk considerably in the last 50 years.  Native
ethnic groups that are not included in the Bumiputera are not
recognized in the constitution and are not officially identified as
“Malay” or automatically granted citizenship.  Foreign workers
constitute some quarter of the labor force.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Brunei’s mobile market
experienced drop-off in subscriber numbers in 2020; in 2022 there
was a concerted effort to build out the fixed-line infrastructure
while progressing towards introducing 5G mobile services; Brunei’s
fixed-line market is one of the few countries in the world to have
displayed significant growth rather than a decline in teledensity
in the last few years; this upward trend is set to continue as the
new Unified National Network (UNN) works diligently to expand and
enhance the fixed-line infrastructure around the country; strong
growth was also seen in the fixed broadband space, on the back of
those same infrastructure developments that are part of the Brunei
Vision 2035 initiative; fixed broadband is starting from a
relatively low base by international standards and is still only at
18%, leaving lots of room for growth; mobile and mobile broadband,
on the other hand, are still suffering from the market contractions
first felt in 2020; Brunei’s 2G GSM network is shut down, with the
spectrum to be reallocated to 3G, 4G, and potentially 5G use

and 1 Pacific Ocean) (2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

increasing investigations, and continuing construction of shelters;
however, officials did not convict any traffickers under its
trafficking statute, for the fifth consecutive year, nor did it
identify any victims; the government continued to detain, deport,

traffickers compelled the victims to engage in unlawful acts

abuse, or confinement; some female migrants entering Brunei on
