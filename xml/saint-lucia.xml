   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The island, with its fine natural harbor at Castries and
burgeoning sugar industry, was contested by England and France
throughout the 17th and early 18th centuries (changing possession
14 times); it was finally ceded to the UK in 1814 and became part
of the British Windward Islands colony. Even after the abolition of
slavery on its plantations in 1834, Saint Lucia remained an
agricultural island, dedicated to producing tropical commodity
crops. In the mid-20th century, Saint Lucia joined the West Indies
Federation (1958–1962) and in 1967 became one of the six members of
the West Indies Associated States, with internal self-government.
In 1979, Saint Lucia gained full independence.</subsection>
