   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The widely scattered islands were first charted in 1803, but
they were too small to host any permanent human habitation. The
1870s and 1880s, saw attempts at guano mining, but these were soon
abandoned. The islands became an Australian territory in 1969 and
its boundaries were extended in 1997. A small meteorological staff
has operated on the Willis Islets since 1921, and several other
islands host unmanned weather stations, beacons, and lighthouses.
Much of the territory lies within marine national nature
reserves.
