   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Tanzania contains some of Africa’s most iconic national parks
and famous paleoanthropological sites, and its diverse cultural
heritage reflects the multiple ethnolinguistic groups that live in
the country. Its long history of integration into trade networks
spanning the Indian Ocean and the African interior led to the
development of Swahili as a common language in much of east Africa
and the introduction of Islam into the region. A number of
independent coastal and island trading posts in what is now
Tanzania came under Portuguese control after 1498 when they began
to take control of much of the coast and Indian Ocean trade. By
1700, the Sultanate of Oman had become the dominant power in the
region after ousting the Portuguese who were also facing a series
of local uprisings. During the following hundred years, Zanzibar -
an archipelago off the coast of Tanzania - became a hub of Indian
Ocean trade, with Arab and Indian traders establishing and
consolidating trade routes with communities in mainland Tanzania
that contributed to the expansion of the slave trade. Zanzibar
briefly become the capital of the Sultanate of Oman before it split
into separate Omani and Zanzibar Sultanates in 1856. Beginning in
the mid-1800s, European explorers, traders, and Christian
missionaries became more active in the region. The Germans
eventually established control over mainland Tanzania - which they
called Tanganyika - and the British established control over
Zanzibar. Tanganyika later came under British administration after
the German defeat in World War I.Tanganyika gained independence from Great Britain in 1961, and
Zanzibar followed in 1963 as a constitutional monarchy. In
Tanganyika, Julius NYERERE, a charismatic and idealistic socialist,
established a one-party political system that centralized power and
encouraged national self-reliance and rural development. In 1964, a
popular uprising overthrew the Sultan in Zanzibar and either killed
or expelled many of the Arabs and Indians who had dominated the
isles for more than 200 years. Later that year, Tanganyika and
Zanzibar combined to form the United Republic of Tanzania, but
Zanzibar retained considerable autonomy. Their two ruling parties
combined to form the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party in 1977.
NYERERE handed over power to Ali Hassan MWINYI in 1985 and remained
CCM chair until 1990. Tanzania held its first multi-party elections
in 1995, but CCM candidates have continued to dominate politics.
Political opposition in Zanzibar has led to four contentious
elections since 1995, in which the ruling party claimed victory
despite international observers' claims of voting irregularities.
In 2001, 35 people in Zanzibar died when soldiers fired on
protestors following the 2000 election. John MAGUFULI won the 2015
presidential election, and the CCM won a two-thirds majority in
Parliament. He was reelected in 2020 and the CCM increased its
majority in an election that was also critiqued by observers.
MAGUFULI died in March 2021 while in office and was
constitutionally succeeded by his vice president, Samia Suluhu
HASSAN.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Tanzania has the largest population in East Africa and the
lowest population density; more than a third of the population is
urban. Tanzania’s youthful population – over 60% of the population
is under 25 as of 2020 – is growing rapidly because of the high
total fertility rate of 4.4 children per woman, as of 2022.
Progress in reducing the birth rate has stalled, sustaining the
country’s nearly 3% annual growth rate. The maternal mortality rate
has improved since 2000, yet it remains very high because of early
and frequent pregnancies, inadequate maternal health services, and
a lack of skilled birth attendants – problems that are worse among
poor and rural women. Tanzania has made strides in reducing under-5
and infant mortality rates, but a recent drop in immunization
threatens to undermine gains in child health. Malaria is a leading
killer of children under 5, while HIV is the main source of adult
mortality.For Tanzania, most migration is internal, rural to urban
movement, while some temporary labor migration from towns to
plantations takes place seasonally for harvests. Tanzania was
Africa’s largest refugee-hosting country for decades, hosting
hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Great Lakes region,
primarily Burundi, over the last fifty years. However, the assisted
repatriation and naturalization of tens of thousands of Burundian
refugees between 2002 and 2014 dramatically reduced the refugee
population. Tanzania is increasingly a transit country for illegal
migrants from the Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes region who are
heading to southern Africa for security reasons and/or economic
opportunities. Some of these migrants choose to settle in
Tanzania.</subsection>

etymology: Dar es Salaam was the name given by
Majid BIN SAID, the first sultan of Zanzibar, to the new city he
founded on the Indian Ocean coast; the Arabic name is commonly
translated as "abode/home of peace"; Dodoma, in the native Gogo
language, means "it has sunk"; supposedly, one day during the rainy
season, an elephant drowned in the area; the villagers in that
place were so struck by what had occurred, that ever since the
locale has been referred to as the place where "it (the elephant)
sunk"</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Tanzania’s telecom sector
enjoys effective competition, particularly in the mobile segment;
the government has encouraged foreign participation to promote
economic growth and social development, and policy reforms have led
to the country having one of the most liberal telecom sectors in
Africa; the government has sought to increase broadband penetration
by a range of measures, including the reduction in VAT charged on
the sale of smartphones and other devices, and reductions in the
cost of data; the MNOs became the leading ISPs following the launch
of mobile broadband services based on 3G and LTE technologies;
operators are hoping for revenue growth in the mobile data services
market, given that the voice market is almost entirely prepaid; the
MNOs have invested in network upgrades, which in turn has supported
m-mobile data use, as well as m-money transfer services and banking
services. Together, these have become a fast-developing source of
revenue; the landing of the first international submarine cables in
the country some years ago revolutionized the telecom market, which
up to that point had entirely depended on expensive satellite
connections; the government aims to complete a national fiber
backbone network, having signed an agreement; in late 2021, the
government announced plans to extend the national backbone network
from about 8,300km to 15,000km by 2023, and to provide ongoing
connectivity to more countries in the region (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line telephone network inadequate
with less than 1 connection per 100 persons; mobile-cellular
service, aided by multiple providers, is increasing rapidly and
exceeds 86 telephones per 100 persons; trunk service provided by
open-wire, microwave radio relay, tropospheric scatter, and
fiber-optic cable; some links being made digital (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 255; landing points
for the EASSy, SEACOM/Tata TGN-Eurasia, and SEAS fiber-optic
submarine cable system linking East Africa with the Middle East;
satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (1 Indian Ocean, 1 Atlantic
Ocean) (2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
      <subsection title="Broadcast media">according to statistics from the Tanzania Communications
Regulatory Authority (TCRA), Tanzania had 45 television stations as
of 2020; 13 of those stations provided national content services
(commercially broadcasting free-to-air television); there are 196
radio stations, most operating at the district level, but also
including 5 independent nationally broadcasting stations and 1
state-owned national radio station; international broadcasting is
available through satellite television which is becoming
increasingly widespread; there are 3 major satellite TV providers
