   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Dominica was the last of the Caribbean islands to be colonized
by Europeans due chiefly to the fierce resistance of the native
Caribs. France ceded possession to Great Britain in 1763, which
colonized the island in 1805. Slavery ended in 1833 and in 1835 the
first three men of African descent were elected to the legislative
assembly of Dominica. In 1871, Dominica became part first of the
British Leeward Islands and then the British Windward Islands until
1958. In 1967, Dominica became an associated state of the UK, and
formally took responsibility for its internal affairs. In 1980, two
years after independence, Dominica's fortunes improved when a
corrupt and tyrannical administration was replaced by that of Mary
Eugenia CHARLES, the first female prime minister in the Caribbean,
who remained in office for 15 years. On 18 September 2017,
Hurricane Maria passed over the island, causing extensive damage to
structures, roads, communications, and the power supply, and
largely destroying critical agricultural areas.</subsection>

formed in the Caribbean some 26 million years ago, it lies in the
middle of the volcanic island arc of the Lesser Antilles that
extends from the island of Saba in the north to Grenada in the
south; of the 16 volcanoes that make up this arc, five are located
on Dominica, more than any other island in the Caribbean: Morne aux
Diables (861 m), Morne Diablotins (1,430 m), Morne Trois Pitons
(1,387 m), Watt Mountain (1,224 m), which last erupted in 1997, and
Morne Plat Pays (940 m); the two best known volcanic features on
Dominica, the Valley of Desolation and the Boiling Lake thermal
areas, lie on the flanks of Watt Mountain and both are popular
tourist destinations</subsection>
      <subsection title="Geography - note">known as "The Nature Island of the Caribbean" due to its
spectacular, lush, and varied flora and fauna, which are protected
by an extensive natural park system; the most mountainous of the
Lesser Antilles, its volcanic peaks are cones of lava craters and
include Boiling Lake, the second-largest, thermally active lake in
the world</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: the telecom sector has seen
a decline in subscriber numbers (particularly for prepaid mobile
services the mainstay of short term visitors) and revenue; fixed
and mobile broadband services are two areas that have benefited
from the crisis as employees and students have resorted to working
from home; one area of the telecom market that is not prepared for
growth is 5G mobile; governments, regulators, and even the mobile
network operators have shown that they have not been investing in
5G opportunities at the present time; network expansion and
enhancements remain concentrated around improving LTE coverage
(2021)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line connections continue to
decline slowly with only two active operators providing about 4
fixed-line connections per 100 persons; subscribership among the
three mobile-cellular providers is about 106 per 100 persons

radiotelephone links to Saint Lucia (2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
