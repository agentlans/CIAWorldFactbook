   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The islands, with large bird and seal populations, lie
approximately 1,000 km east of the Falkland Islands and have been
under British administration since 1908 - except for a brief period
in 1982 when Argentina occupied them. Grytviken, on South Georgia,
was a 19th and early 20th century whaling station. Famed explorer
Ernest SHACKLETON stopped there in 1914 en route to his ill-fated
attempt to cross Antarctica on foot. He returned some 20 months
later with a few companions in a small boat and arranged a
successful rescue for the rest of his crew, stranded off the
Antarctic Peninsula. He died in 1922 on a subsequent expedition and
is buried in Grytviken. Today, the station houses scientists from
the British Antarctic Survey. Recognizing the importance of
preserving the marine stocks in adjacent waters, the UK, in 1993,
extended the exclusive fishing zone from 12 nm to 200 nm around
each island.</subsection>

etymology: South Georgia was named "the Isle of
Georgia" in 1775 by Captain James COOK in honor of British King
GEORGE III; the explorer also discovered the Sandwich Islands Group
that year, which he named "Sandwich Land" after John MONTAGU, the
Earl of Sandwich and First Lord of the Admiralty; the word "South"
was later added to distinguish these islands from the other
Sandwich Islands, now known as the Hawaiian Islands</subsection>

      <subsection title="Flag description">blue with the flag of the UK in the upper hoist-side quadrant
and the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands coat of arms
centered on the outer half of the flag; the coat of arms features a
shield with a golden lion rampant, holding a torch; the shield is
supported by a fur seal on the left and a Macaroni penguin on the
right; a reindeer appears above the crest, and below the shield on
a scroll is the motto LEO TERRAM PROPRIAM PROTEGAT (Let the Lion
Protect its Own Land); the lion with the torch represents the UK
and discovery; the background of the shield, blue and white
estoiles, are found in the coat of arms of James Cook, discoverer
of the islands; all the outer supporting animals represented are
native to the islands</subsection>
