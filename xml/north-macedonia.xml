   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">North Macedonia gained its independence peacefully from
Yugoslavia in 1991 under the name of "Macedonia." Greek objection
to the new country’s name, insisting it implied territorial
pretensions to the northern Greek province of Macedonia, and
democratic backsliding for several years stalled the country’s
movement toward Euro-Atlantic integration. Immediately after
Macedonia declared independence, Greece sought to block Macedonian
efforts to gain UN membership if the name "Macedonia" was used. The
country was eventually admitted to the UN in 1993 as "The former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia," and at the same time it agreed to
UN-sponsored negotiations on the name dispute. In 1995, Greece
lifted a 20-month trade embargo and the two countries agreed to
normalize relations, but the issue of the name remained unresolved
and negotiations for a solution continued. Over time, the US and
over 130 other nations recognized Macedonia by its constitutional
name, Republic of Macedonia. Ethnic Albanian grievances over
perceived political and economic inequities escalated into a
conflict in 2001 that eventually led to the internationally
brokered Ohrid Framework Agreement, which ended the fighting and
established guidelines for constitutional amendments and the
creation of new laws that enhanced the rights of minorities. In
January 2018, the government adopted a new law on languages, which
elevated the Albanian language to an official language at the
national level, with the Macedonian language remaining the sole
official language in international relations. Relations between
ethnic Macedonians and ethnic Albanians remain complicated,
however.North Macedonia's pro-Western government has used its time in
office since 2017 to sign a historic deal with Greece in June 2018
to end the name dispute and revive Skopje's NATO and EU membership
prospects. This followed a nearly three-year political crisis that
engulfed the country but ended in June 2017 following a
six-month-long government formation period after a closely
contested election in December 2016. The crisis began after the
2014 legislative and presidential election, and escalated in 2015
when the opposition party began releasing wiretapped material that
revealed alleged widespread government corruption and abuse.
Although an EU candidate since 2005, North Macedonia has yet to
open EU accession negotiations. The country still faces challenges,
including fully implementing reforms to overcome years of
democratic backsliding and stimulating economic growth and
development. In June 2018, Macedonia and Greece signed the Prespa
Accord whereby the Republic of Macedonia agreed to change its name
to the Republic of North Macedonia. Following ratification by both
countries, the agreement went in to force on 12 February 2019.
North Macedonia signed an accession protocol to become a NATO
member state in February 2019.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">as part of the EU pre-accession process, North Macedonia has built closer economic ties with the Union which accounts for 77.5% of Macedonia’s exports and just over half of its imports; closer regulatory and administrative ties with European Commission (EC) institutions have done much to develop the telecom sector and prepare the market for the competitive environment encouraged in the EU; as part of EU integration legislation North Macedonia has implemented the principles of the EU’s regulatory framework for communications, established an independent regulator and set out several provisions to provide for a competitive telecom market, including wholesale access to the incumbent’s fixed-line network; broadband services are widely available, with effective competition between DSL and cable platforms complemented by wireless broadband and a developing fiber sector; the number of DSL subscribers has continued to fall in recent years as customers are migrated to fiber networks; the MNOs are increasingly focused on expanding their 5G networks, seeking stronger coverage across North Macedonia’s high value urban areas; mobile data services are also becoming increasingly important following investments in LTE network rollouts and in upgrades to LTE-A technology (2022)</note>
