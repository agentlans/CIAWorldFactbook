   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">South Sudan, which gained independence from Sudan on 9 July
2011, is the world’s newest country. Home to a diverse array of
mainly Nilotic ethnolinguistic groups that settled in the territory
in the 15th through 19th centuries, South Sudanese society is
heavily dependent on seasonal fluctuations in precipitation and
seasonal migration. The land comprising modern-day South Sudan was
conquered first by Egypt and later ruled jointly by
Egyptian-British colonial administrators in the late 19th century.
Christian missionaries propagated the spread of English and
Christianity, rather than Arabic and Islam, leading to significant
cultural differences between the northern and southern parts of
Sudan. When Sudan gained its independence in 1956, the Southern
region received assurances that it would participate fully in the
political system. However, the Arab government in Khartoum reneged
on its promises, prompting two periods of civil war (1955-1972 and
1983-2005) in which as many as 2.5 million people died - mostly
civilians - due largely to starvation and drought. The Second
Sudanese civil war was one of the deadliest since WWII and left
Southern Sudanese society devastated by humanitarian crises and
economic deterioration. Peace talks resulted in a US-backed
Comprehensive Peace Agreement, signed in January 2005, which
granted the South a six-year period of autonomy followed by a
referendum on final status. The result of this referendum, held in
January 2011, was a vote of 98% in favor of secession.

Since independence, South Sudan has struggled to form a viable
governing system and has been plagued by widespread corruption,
political conflict, and communal violence. In December 2013,
conflict erupted between forces loyal to President Salva KIIR, a
Dinka, and forces loyal to Vice President Riek MACHAR, a Nuer. The
conflict quickly spread throughout the country and unfolded along
ethnic lines, killing tens of thousands and creating a dire
humanitarian crisis, with millions of South Sudanese displaced and
food insecure. KIIR and MACHAR signed a peace agreement in August
2015 that created a Transitional Government of National Unity in
April 2016. However, in July 2016, renewed fighting broke out in
Juba between KIIR and MACHAR’s forces, plunging the country back
into conflict and drawing in additional armed opposition groups,
including those in the southern Equatoria region that had largely
stayed out of the first round of civil war. A "revitalized" peace
agreement was signed in September 2018, which mostly ended the
fighting. The government and most armed opposition groups agreed
that they would form a unified national army, create a transitional
government by May 2019, and prepare for elections in December 2022.
Subsequent extensions pushed elections to late 2023, and the
transitional government was formed in February 2020, when MACHAR
returned to Juba as first vice president. Since 2020,
implementation of the peace agreement has been stalled as the
parties wrangle over power-sharing arrangements, contributing to an
uptick in communal violence and the country’s worst food security
crisis since independence, with 7 of 11 million South Sudanese
citizens in need of humanitarian assistance.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">South Sudan, independent from Sudan since July 2011 after
decades of civil war, is one of the world’s poorest countries and
ranks among the lowest in many socioeconomic categories. Problems
are exacerbated by ongoing tensions with Sudan over oil revenues
and land borders, fighting between government forces and rebel
groups, and inter-communal violence. Most of the population lives
off of farming, while smaller numbers rely on animal husbandry;
abput 80% of the populace lives in rural areas. The maternal
mortality rate is among the world’s highest for a variety of
reasons, including a shortage of health care workers, facilities,
and supplies; poor roads and a lack of transport; and cultural
beliefs that prevent women from seeking obstetric care. Most women
marry and start having children early, giving birth at home with
the assistance of traditional birth attendants, who are unable to
handle complications.Educational attainment is extremely poor due to the lack of
schools, qualified teachers, and materials. Only one-third of the
population is literate (the rate is even lower among women), and
half live below the poverty line. Teachers and students are also
struggling with the switch from Arabic to English as the language
of instruction. Many adults missed out on schooling because of
warfare and displacement.More than 2 million South Sudanese have sought refuge in
neighboring countries since the current conflict began in December
2013. Another 2.2 million South Sudanese are internally displaced
as of October 2022. Despite South Sudan’s instability and lack of
infrastructure and social services, more than 275,000 people had
fled to South Sudan to escape fighting in Sudan as of December
2022.</subsection>
