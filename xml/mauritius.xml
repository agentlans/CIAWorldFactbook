   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Although known to Arab and European sailors since at least the
early 1500s, the island of Mauritius was uninhabited until 1638
when the Dutch established a settlement named in honor of Prince
Maurits van NASSAU. Their presence led to the rapid disappearance
of the flightless dodo bird that has since become one of the most
well-known examples of extinction in modern times. The Dutch
abandoned their financially distressed settlement in 1710, although
a number of formerly enslaved people remained. In 1722, the French
established what would become a highly profitable settlement
focused on sugar cane plantations that were reliant on the labor of
enslaved people brought to Mauritius from other parts of Africa. In
the 1790s, the island had a brief period of autonomous rule when
plantation owners rejected French control because of laws ending
slavery that were temporarily in effect during the French
Revolution. Britain captured the Island in 1810 as part of the
Napoleonic Wars but kept most of the French administrative
structure, which remains to this day in the form of the country’s
legal codes and widespread use of the French Creole language. The
abolition of slavery in 1835 - later than most other British
colonies - led to increased reliance on contracted laborers from
the Indian subcontinent to work on plantations. Today their
descendants form the majority of the population. Mauritius remained
a strategically important British naval base, and later an air
station, playing a role during World War II for anti-submarine and
convoy operations, as well as for the collection of signals
intelligence.Mauritius gained independence from the UK in 1968 as a
Parliamentary Republic and has remained a stable democracy with
regular free elections and a positive human rights record. The
country also attracted considerable foreign investment and now has
one of Africa's highest per capita incomes. Mauritius’ often
fractious coalition politics has been dominated by two prominent
families each of which has had father-son pairs who have been prime
minister over multiple, often nonconsecutive, terms. Seewoosagur
RAMGOOLAM (1968-76) was Mauritius’ first prime minister and he was
succeeded by Anerood JUGNAUTH (1982-95, 2000-03, 2014-17); his son
Navin RAMGOOLAM (1995-2000, 2005-14); and Paul Raymond BERENGER
(2003-05), the only non-Hindu prime minister of post-independence
Mauritius. In 2017, Pravind JUGNAUTH became prime minister after
his father stepped down short of completing his term, and he was
elected in his own right in 2019. Mauritius claims the French
island of Tromelin and the British Chagos Archipelago (British
Indian Ocean Territory). Since 2017, Mauritius has secured
favorable UN General Assembly resolutions and an International
Court of Justice advisory opinion relating to its sovereignty
dispute with the UK.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Mauritius has transitioned from a country of high fertility and
high mortality rates in the 1950s and mid-1960s to one with among
the lowest population growth rates in the developing world today.
After World War II, Mauritius’ population began to expand quickly
due to increased fertility and a dramatic drop in mortality rates
as a result of improved health care and the eradication of malaria.
This period of heightened population growth – reaching about 3% a
year – was followed by one of the world’s most rapid birth rate
declines.The total fertility rate fell from 6.2 children per women in
1963 to 3.2 in 1972 – largely the result of improved educational
attainment, especially among young women, accompanied by later
marriage and the adoption of family planning methods. The family
planning programs’ success was due to support from the government
and eventually the traditionally pronatalist religious communities,
which both recognized that controlling population growth was
necessary because of Mauritius’ small size and limited resources.
Mauritius’ fertility rate has consistently been below replacement
level since the late 1990s, a rate that is substantially lower than
nearby countries in southern Africa.With no indigenous population, Mauritius’ ethnic mix is a
product of more than two centuries of European colonialism and
continued international labor migration. Sugar production relied on
slave labor mainly from Madagascar, Mozambique, and East Africa
from the early 18th century until its abolition in 1835, when
slaves were replaced with indentured Indians. Most of the influx of
indentured labor – peaking between the late 1830s and early 1860s –
settled permanently creating massive population growth of more than
7% a year and reshaping the island’s social and cultural
composition. While Indians represented about 12% of Mauritius’
population in 1837, they and their descendants accounted for
roughly two-thirds by the end of the 19th century. Most were
Hindus, but the majority of the free Indian traders were
Muslims.Mauritius again turned to overseas labor when its success in
clothing and textile exports led to a labor shortage in the
mid-1980s. Clothing manufacturers brought in contract workers
(increasingly women) from China, India, and, to a lesser extent
Bangladesh and Madagascar, who worked longer hours for lower wages
under poor conditions and were viewed as more productive than
locals. Downturns in the sugar and textile industries in the
mid-2000s and a lack of highly qualified domestic workers for
Mauritius’ growing services sector led to the emigration of
low-skilled workers and a reliance on skilled foreign labor. Since
2007, Mauritius has pursued a circular migration program to enable
citizens to acquire new skills and savings abroad and then return
home to start businesses and to invest in the country’s
development.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: the telecom sector in
Mauritius has long been supported by the varied needs of tourists;
this has stimulated the mobile market, leading to a particularly
high penetration rate; the response of the country’s telcos to
tourist requirements also contributed to the country being among
the first in the region to provide services based on 3G and WiMAX
technologies; the incumbent telco provides comprehensive LTE and
fiber broadband coverage, and in late 2021 it launched a gigabit
fiber-based broadband service; the country has seen improved
international internet capacity in recent years, with direct cables
linking to India, Madagascar, and South Africa, as well as other
connections to Rodrigues and Reunion; mobile subscribers in
Mauritius secured 5G services in mid-2021;  this followed the
regulator’s award of spectrum in two bands to the MNOs (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line teledensity over 37 per 100
persons and mobile-cellular services teledensity roughly 150 per

         <br/>
international: country code - 230; landing points
for the SAFE, MARS, IOX Cable System, METISS and LION
submarine cable system that provides links to Asia, Africa,
Southeast Asia, Indian Ocean Islands of Reunion, Madagascar, and
Mauritius; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Indian Ocean); new
microwave link to Reunion; HF radiotelephone links to several
countries (2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
