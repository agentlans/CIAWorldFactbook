   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Saudi Arabia is the birthplace of Islam and home to Islam's two
holiest shrines in Mecca and Medina. The king's official title is
the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. The modern Saudi state was
founded in 1932 by ABD AL-AZIZ bin Abd al-Rahman AL SAUD (Ibn Saud)
after a 30-year campaign to unify most of the Arabian Peninsula.
One of his male descendants rules the country today, as required by
the country's 1992 Basic Law. Following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
in 1990, Saudi Arabia accepted the Kuwaiti royal family and 400,000
refugees while allowing Western and Arab troops to deploy on its
soil for the liberation of Kuwait the following year. The
continuing presence of foreign troops on Saudi soil after the
liberation of Kuwait became a source of tension between the royal
family and the public until all operational US troops left the
country in 2003. Major terrorist attacks in May and November 2003
spurred a strong ongoing campaign against domestic terrorism and
extremism. US troops returned to the Kingdom in October 2019 after
attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure.From 2005 to 2015, King ABDALLAH bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud
incrementally modernized the Kingdom. Driven by personal ideology
and political pragmatism, he introduced a series of social and
economic initiatives, including expanding employment and social
opportunities for women, attracting foreign investment, increasing
the role of the private sector in the economy, and discouraging
businesses from hiring foreign workers. These reforms have
accelerated under King SALMAN bin Abd al-Aziz, who ascended to the
throne in 2015, and has since lifted the Kingdom's ban on women
driving, implemented education reforms, funded green initiatives,
and allowed cinemas to operate for the first time in
decades. Saudi Arabia saw some protests during the 2011 Arab
Spring but not the level of bloodshed seen in protests elsewhere in
the region. Shia Muslims in the Eastern Province protested
primarily against the detention of political prisoners, endemic
discrimination, and Bahraini and Saudi Government actions in
Bahrain. Riyadh took a cautious but firm approach by arresting some
protesters but releasing most of them quickly and by using its
state-sponsored clerics to counter political and Islamist
activism.The government held its first-ever elections in 2005 and 2011,
when Saudis went to the polls to elect municipal councilors. In
December 2015, women were allowed to vote and stand as candidates
for the first time in municipal council elections, with 19 women
winning seats. After King SALMAN ascended to the throne in 2015, he
placed the first next-generation prince, MUHAMMAD BIN NAYIF bin Abd
al-Aziz Al Saud, in the line of succession as Crown Prince. He
designated his son, MUHAMMAD BIN SALMAN bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud, as
the Deputy Crown Prince. In March 2015, Saudi Arabia led a
coalition of 10 countries in a military campaign to restore the
legitimate government of Yemen, which had been ousted by Huthi
forces allied with former president ALI ABDULLAH al-Salih. The war
in Yemen has drawn international criticism for civilian casualties
and its effect on the country’s dire humanitarian situation. In
December 2015, then Deputy Crown Prince MUHAMMAD BIN SALMAN
announced Saudi Arabia would lead a 34-nation Islamic Coalition to
fight terrorism (it has since grown to 41 nations). In May 2017,
Saudi Arabia inaugurated the Global Center for Combatting Extremist
Ideology (also known as "Etidal") as part of its ongoing efforts to
counter violent extremism. In June 2017, King SALMAN elevated
MUHAMMAD BIN SALMAN to Crown Prince. Since then, he has jockeyed
for influence with neighboring countries in a bid to be the
region’s main power broker.The country remains a leading producer of oil and natural gas
and holds about 17% of the world's proven oil reserves as of 2020.
The government continues to pursue economic reform and
diversification, particularly since Saudi Arabia's accession to the
WTO in 2005, and promotes foreign investment in the Kingdom. In
April 2016, the Saudi Government announced a broad set of
socio-economic reforms, known as Vision 2030. Low global oil prices
throughout 2015 and 2016 significantly lowered Saudi Arabia’s
governmental revenue. In response, the government cut subsidies on
water, electricity, and gasoline; reduced government employee
compensation packages; and announced limited new land taxes. In
coordination with OPEC and some key non-OPEC countries, Saudi
Arabia agreed to cut oil output in early 2017 to regulate supply
and help elevate global prices. In early 2020, this agreement by
the so-called OPEC+ coalition collapsed. Saudi Arabia launched a
price war by flooding the market with low-priced oil before
returning to the negotiating table to agree to OPEC+’s largest and
longest-lasting output cut. This cut helped to buoy prices that had
collapsed as a result of the price war and the effect of the
COVID-19 pandemic. </subsection>

to the early twentieth century and is closely associated with the

manufactured with differing obverse and reverse sides so that the

         <note title="general assessment">Saudi Arabia’s telecom and ICT sectors continue to benefit from the range of programs aimed at diversifying the economy away from a dependence on oil, and establishing a wider digital transformation over the next decade; an essential element of this has been the widening reach of 5G networks, which by mid-2021 reached about half of the population and the majority of cities; the MNOs have focused investment on upgrading LTE infrastructure and further developing 5G; this in part is aimed at generating additional revenue from mobile data services, and also to their contribution to the Vision 2030 program; the ongoing pandemic has resulted in more people working and schooling from home during periods of restricted travel; this has stimulated growth in mobile data traffic, while the government has encouraged non-cash transactions and so helped develop the vast e-commerce market; while Saudi Arabia’s fixed broadband penetration remains relatively low, there has been a concentration of fiber infrastructure and the Kingdom has developed one of the fastest services in the region (2022)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>
