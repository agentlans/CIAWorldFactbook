   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Bolivia, named after independence fighter Simon BOLIVAR, broke
away from Spanish rule in 1825. Much of its subsequent history has
consisted of a series of coups and countercoups, with the last coup
occurring in 1978. Democratic civilian rule was established in
1982, but leaders have faced problems of deep-seated poverty,
social unrest, and illegal drug production.In December 2005, Bolivians elected Movement Toward Socialism
leader Evo MORALES president - by the widest margin of any leader
since the restoration of civilian rule in 1982 - after he ran on a
promise to change the country's traditional political class and
empower the nation's poor and indigenous majority. In December 2009
and October 2014, President MORALES easily won reelection. His
party maintained control of the legislative branch of the
government, which has allowed him to continue his "process of
change." In February 2016, MORALES narrowly lost a referendum to
approve a constitutional amendment that would have allowed him to
compete in the 2019 presidential election. However, a 2017 Supreme
Court ruling stating that term limits violate human rights provided
the justification for MORALES to be chosen by his party to run
again in 2019. MORALES attempted to claim victory in the October
2019 election, but widespread allegations of electoral fraud,
rising violence, and pressure from the military ultimately forced
him to flee the country. An interim government, led by President
Jeanine ANEZ Chavez, prepared new elections that took place in
October 2020; President Luis Alberto ARCE Catacora took office the
following month.</subsection>

note: results among surveys vary based on the
wording of the ethnicity question and the available response
choices; the 2001 national census did not provide "Mestizo" as a
response choice, resulting in a much higher proportion of
respondents identifying themselves as belonging to one of the
available indigenous ethnicity choices; the use of "Mestizo" and
"Cholo" varies among response choices in surveys, with surveys
using the terms interchangeably, providing one or the other as a
response choice, or providing the two as separate response

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Bolivia ranks at or near the bottom among Latin American
countries in several areas of health and development, including
poverty, education, fertility, malnutrition, mortality, and life
expectancy. On the positive side, more children are being
vaccinated and more pregnant women are getting prenatal care and
having skilled health practitioners attend their births.Bolivia’s income inequality is the highest in Latin America and
one of the highest in the world. Public education is of poor
quality, and educational opportunities are among the most unevenly
distributed in Latin America, with girls and indigenous and rural
children less likely to be literate or to complete primary school.
The lack of access to education and family planning services helps
to sustain Bolivia’s high fertility rate—approximately three
children per woman. Bolivia’s lack of clean water and basic
sanitation, especially in rural areas, contributes to health
problems.Between 7% and 16% of Bolivia’s population lives abroad
(estimates vary in part because of illegal migration). Emigrants
primarily seek jobs and better wages in Argentina (the principal
destination), the US, and Spain. In recent years, more restrictive
immigration policies in Europe and the US have increased the flow
of Bolivian emigrants to neighboring countries. Fewer Bolivians
migrated to Brazil in 2015 and 2016 because of its recession;
increasing numbers have been going to Chile, mainly to work as
miners.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: the structure of Bolivia’s
fixed telecom market is different from most other countries; local
services are primarily provided by 15 telecom cooperatives; these
are non-profit-making companies privately owned and controlled by
their users; since the market was liberalized, the cooperatives
have also provided long-distance telephony, while several also
offer broadband and pay TV service; they have invested in network
upgrades in a bid to improve services for customers, and to expand
their footprints; Bolivia has a multi-carrier system wherein
consumers can choose a long-distance carrier for each call by
dialing the carrier’s prefix; several operators have also adopted
fixed-wireless technologies, and some rent fiber-optic capacity;
the fixed broadband services remain expensive, though the cost of
bandwidth is only a fraction of what it was only a few years ago;
services are still unavailable in many rural and remote areas, and
even in some of the major urban areas; being a landlocked country,
Bolivia had no direct access to submarine cable networks, and
relies on satellite services or terrestrial links across
neighboring countries; in September 2020 a new cable running via
Peru, has increased capacity and contributed to a dramatic fall in
end-user prices; fixed broadband services are fast migrating from
DSL to fiber, while there are also cable broadband services
available in some major cities; in 2007 the focus was on providing
telecom services in rural areas under a project known as ‘Territory
with Total Coverage’; this project aims to increase telecom
coverage through mobile rather than through fixed networks; Bolivia
has almost twenty times as many mobile phone subscribers as fixed
line connections, and the trend towards fixed-mobile substitution
continues; all the mobile companies offer 3G and LTE services; due
to the poor quality, high cost, and poor reach of DSL, mobile
networks have become the principal platform for voice services and
data access; by early 2021 companies’ networks reached more than
95% of the population; about 92% of all internet accesses are via
smartphones (2021)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: 5 per 100 fixed-line, mobile-cellular
telephone use expanding rapidly and teledensity stands at 101 per
100 persons; most telephones are concentrated in La Paz, Santa
Cruz, and other capital cities (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 591; Bolivia has no
direct access to submarine cable networks and must therefore
connect to the rest of the world either via satellite or through
terrestrial links across neighboring countries; satellite earth
station - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) (2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

Ocean that the country lost to Chile in the War of the Pacific
(1879-1884); every year on 23 March, the Navy participates in
parades and government ceremonies commemorating the Día Del Mar

Bolivia-Chile: Despite tariff-free access to ports in
southern Peru and northern Chile, Bolivia persists with its
long-standing claims to regain sovereign access to the Pacific
Ocean.<br/>
         <br/>
Bolivia-Peru: Despite tariff-free access to ports in
southern Peru and northern Chile, Bolivia persists with its
long-standing claims to regain sovereign access to the Pacific
Ocean. Smuggling of archaeological artifacts from Peru to Bolivia,
illegal timber and narcotics smuggling, human trafficking, and
falsified documents are current issues. <br/>
         <br/>
Bolivia-Brazil: The Roboré Accord of March 29, 1958 placed
the long-disputed Isla Suárez/Ilha de Guajará-Mirim, a fluvial
island on the Río Mamoré, between the two towns of Guajará-Mirim
(Brazil) and Guayaramerin (Bolivia), under Bolivian administration
but did not resolve the sovereignty dispute<br/>
         <br/>
Bolivia-Argentina: Contraband smuggling, human
trafficking, and illegal narcotic trafficking are problems in the
porous areas of the border. <br/>
         <br/>
Bolivia-Paraguay: On April 27, 2009, the president of
Argentina hosted the presidents of Bolivia and Paraguay together
