   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Bolivia, named after independence fighter Simon BOLIVAR, broke
away from Spanish rule in 1825. Much of its subsequent history has
consisted of a series of coups and countercoups, with the last coup
occurring in 1978. Democratic civilian rule was established in
1982, but leaders have faced problems of deep-seated poverty,
social unrest, and illegal drug production.In December 2005, Bolivians elected Movement Toward Socialism
leader Evo MORALES president - by the widest margin of any leader
since the restoration of civilian rule in 1982 - after he ran on a
promise to change the country's traditional political class and
empower the nation's poor and indigenous majority. In December 2009
and October 2014, President MORALES easily won reelection. His
party maintained control of the legislative branch of the
government, which has allowed him to continue his "process of
change." In February 2016, MORALES narrowly lost a referendum to
approve a constitutional amendment that would have allowed him to
compete in the 2019 presidential election. However, a 2017 Supreme
Court ruling stating that term limits violate human rights provided
the justification for MORALES to be chosen by his party to run
again in 2019. MORALES attempted to claim victory in the October
2019 election, but widespread allegations of electoral fraud,
rising violence, and pressure from the military ultimately forced
him to flee the country. An interim government, led by President
Jeanine ANEZ Chavez, prepared new elections that took place in
October 2020; President Luis Alberto ARCE Catacora took office the
following month.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Bolivia ranks at or near the bottom among Latin American
countries in several areas of health and development, including
poverty, education, fertility, malnutrition, mortality, and life
expectancy. On the positive side, more children are being
vaccinated and more pregnant women are getting prenatal care and
having skilled health practitioners attend their births.Bolivia’s income inequality is the highest in Latin America and
one of the highest in the world. Public education is of poor
quality, and educational opportunities are among the most unevenly
distributed in Latin America, with girls and indigenous and rural
children less likely to be literate or to complete primary school.
The lack of access to education and family planning services helps
to sustain Bolivia’s high fertility rate—approximately three
children per woman. Bolivia’s lack of clean water and basic
sanitation, especially in rural areas, contributes to health
problems.Between 7% and 16% of Bolivia’s population lives abroad
(estimates vary in part because of illegal migration). Emigrants
primarily seek jobs and better wages in Argentina (the principal
destination), the US, and Spain. In recent years, more restrictive
immigration policies in Europe and the US have increased the flow
of Bolivian emigrants to neighboring countries. Fewer Bolivians
migrated to Brazil in 2015 and 2016 because of its recession;
increasing numbers have been going to Chile, mainly to work as
miners.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">
         <note title="general assessment">the structure of Bolivia’s fixed telecom market is different from most other countries; local services are primarily provided by 15 telecom cooperatives; these are non-profit-making companies privately owned and controlled by their users; since the market was liberalized, the cooperatives have also provided long-distance telephony, while several also offer broadband and pay TV service; they have invested in network upgrades in a bid to improve services for customers, and to expand their footprints; Bolivia has a multi-carrier system wherein consumers can choose a long-distance carrier for each call by dialing the carrier’s prefix; several operators have also adopted fixed-wireless technologies, and some rent fiber-optic capacity; the fixed broadband services remain expensive, though the cost of bandwidth is only a fraction of what it was only a few years ago; services are still unavailable in many rural and remote areas, and even in some of the major urban areas; being a landlocked country, Bolivia had no direct access to submarine cable networks, and relies on satellite services or terrestrial links across neighboring countries; in September 2020 a new cable running via Peru, has increased capacity and contributed to a dramatic fall in end-user prices; fixed broadband services are fast migrating from DSL to fiber, while there are also cable broadband services available in some major cities; in 2007 the focus was on providing telecom services in rural areas under a project known as ‘Territory with Total Coverage’; this project aims to increase telecom coverage through mobile rather than through fixed networks; Bolivia has almost twenty times as many mobile phone subscribers as fixed line connections, and the trend towards fixed-mobile substitution continues; all the mobile companies offer 3G and LTE services; due to the poor quality, high cost, and poor reach of DSL, mobile networks have become the principal platform for voice services and data access; by early 2021 companies’ networks reached more than 95% of the population; about 92% of all internet accesses are via smartphones (2021)</note>
         <note title="domestic">5 per 100 fixed-line, mobile-cellular telephone use expanding rapidly and teledensity stands at 101 per 100 persons; most telephones are concentrated in La Paz, Santa Cruz, and other capital cities (2020)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>

of navigable rivers to combat narcotics trafficking and smuggling,
provide disaster relief, and deliver supplies to remote rural
areas, as well as for maintaining a presence on Lake Titicaca; the
Navy also exists in part to cultivate a maritime tradition and as a
reminder of Bolivia’s desire to regain the access to the Pacific
Ocean that the country lost to Chile in the War of the Pacific
(1879-1884); every year on 23 March, the Navy participates in
parades and government ceremonies commemorating the Día Del Mar

   <section title="Transnational Issues">
      <subsection title="Disputes - international">Contraband smuggling, human trafficking, and illegal narcotic
trafficking are problems in the porous areas of its border regions
with all of its neighbors (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and
Peru).

Bolivia-Chile: Despite tariff-free access to ports in
southern Peru and northern Chile, Bolivia persists with its
long-standing claims to regain sovereign access to the Pacific
Ocean.

Bolivia-Peru: Despite tariff-free access to ports in
southern Peru and northern Chile, Bolivia persists with its
long-standing claims to regain sovereign access to the Pacific
Ocean. Smuggling of archaeological artifacts from Peru to Bolivia,
illegal timber and narcotics smuggling, human trafficking, and
falsified documents are current issues. 

Bolivia-Brazil: The Roboré Accord of March 29, 1958 placed
the long-disputed Isla Suárez/Ilha de Guajará-Mirim, a fluvial
island on the Río Mamoré, between the two towns of Guajará-Mirim
(Brazil) and Guayaramerin (Bolivia), under Bolivian administration
but did not resolve the sovereignty dispute

Bolivia-Argentina: Contraband smuggling, human
trafficking, and illegal narcotic trafficking are problems in the
porous areas of the border. 

Bolivia-Paraguay: On April 27, 2009, the president of
Argentina hosted the presidents of Bolivia and Paraguay together
with representatives of the fiver other guarantor states
-- Brazil, Chile, Peru, the United States, and Uruguay
-- to the signing for the Final Record of the Boundary
Commission in execution of the 1938 Peace Treaty between Bolivia
and Paraguay.</subsection>
