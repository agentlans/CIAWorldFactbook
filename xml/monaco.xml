   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Genoese built a fortress on the site of present day Monaco
in 1215. The current ruling GRIMALDI family first seized control in
1297 but was not able to permanently secure its holding until 1419.
Economic development was spurred in the late 19th century with a
railroad linkup to France and the opening of a casino. Since then,
the principality's mild climate, splendid scenery, and gambling
facilities have made Monaco world famous as a tourist and
recreation center.</subsection>
