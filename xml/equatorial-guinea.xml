   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Equatorial Guinea gained independence in 1968 after 190 years of
Spanish rule; it is one of the smallest countries in Africa
consisting of a mainland territory and five inhabited islands. The
capital of Malabo is located on the island of Bioko, approximately
25 km from the Cameroonian coastline in the Gulf of Guinea. Between
1968 and 1979, autocratic President Francisco MACIAS NGUEMA
virtually destroyed all of the country's political, economic, and
social institutions before being deposed by his nephew Teodoro
OBIANG NGUEMA MBASOGO in a violent coup. President OBIANG has ruled
since October 1979 and has been elected several times, most
recently in 2016. Although nominally a constitutional democracy
since 1991, presidential and legislative elections since 1996 have
been considered flawed. The president exerts almost total control
over the political system and has placed legal and bureaucratic
barriers that hinder political opposition. Equatorial Guinea
experienced rapid economic growth in the early years of the 21st
century due to the discovery of large offshore oil reserves in
1996. Production peaked in late 2004 and has slowly declined since,
although aggressive searches for new oilfields continue. Despite
the country's economic windfall from oil production, resulting in
massive increases in government revenue in past years, generally
lower global oil prices since 2014 and depreciating oil fields have
placed significant strain on the state budget. While oil revenues
have mainly been used for the development of infrastructure,
corruption has hindered socio-economic development and there have
been limited improvements in the population's living standards.
Equatorial Guinea continues to seek to diversify its economy and to
increase foreign investment. The country hosts major regional and
international conferences and continues to seek a greater role in
international affairs, and leadership in the sub-region. </subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Equatorial Guinea is one of the smallest and least populated
countries in continental Africa and is the only independent African
country where Spanish is an official language. Despite a boom in
oil production in the 1990s, authoritarianism, corruption, and
resource mismanagement have concentrated the benefits among a small
elite. These practices have perpetuated income inequality and
unbalanced development, such as low public spending on education
and health care. Unemployment remains problematic because the
oil-dominated economy employs a small labor force dependent on
skilled foreign workers. The agricultural sector, Equatorial
Guinea’s main employer, continues to deteriorate because of a lack
of investment and the migration of rural workers to urban areas.
About two-thirds of the population lives below the poverty line as
of 2020.Equatorial Guinea’s large and growing youth population – about
60% are under the age of 25 as of 2022 – is particularly affected
because job creation in the non-oil sectors is limited, and young
people often do not have the skills needed in the labor market.
Equatorial Guinean children frequently enter school late, have poor
attendance, and have high dropout rates. Thousands of Equatorial
Guineans fled across the border to Gabon in the 1970s to escape the
dictatorship of Francisco MACIAS NGUEMA; smaller numbers have
followed in the decades since. Continued inequitable economic
growth and high youth unemployment increases the likelihood of
ethnic and regional violence.</subsection>

attempted boarding to steal valuables from ships and crews are the
most common types of incidents, almost a third of all incidents
involve a hijacking and/or kidnapping; in 2021, 57 crew members
were kidnapped in seven separate incidents in the Gulf of Guinea,

populations, an effort that had stalled for five years; however,
the government still has not convicted a trafficker or any
complicit government employees under its 2004 anti-trafficking law;
a lack of training among judicial officials has resulted in
potential trafficking crimes being tried under related statutes;
