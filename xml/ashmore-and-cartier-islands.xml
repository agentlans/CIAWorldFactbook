   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Indonesian fishermen have long fished in the area around Ashmore
Reef and Cartier Island. British explorers were the first Europeans
to see Cartier Island and Ashmore Reef in 1800 and 1811,
respectively. American whalers frequently sailed by the islands in
the 1850s and later settled to mine the phosphate deposits on
Ashmore Reef, which were exhausted by 1891. The UK disputed US
access to Ashmore Reef and formally annexed it in 1878. Cartier
Island was annexed in 1909. In 1931, the UK transferred the islands
to Australia, which accepted them in 1934 as part of Western
Australia. In 1938, Australia transferred governance to the
Northern Territory. During World War II, the islands saw several
Allied ship visits and post-war, Cartier Island became a bombing
range. In 1978, governance of Ashmore and Cartier Islands was moved
to the federal government. Ashmore Reef and Cartier Island became
marine reserves in 1983 and 2000 respectively.

In 1974, Australia and Indonesia signed a memorandum of
understanding (MOU) to allow Indonesian fishermen to continue
fishing around the islands. The MOU also allows Indonesian
fishermen to visit the graves of past fishermen, replenish their
fresh water, and shelter in the West Island Lagoon of Ashmore Reef.
In the 1990s, Indonesia challenged Australia’s claims to the
islands, which was settled in a maritime boundary treaty in 1997.
The islands were a popular first point of contact for migrants and
refugees seeking to enter Australia, so in 2001, Australia declared
the islands outside the Australian migration zone.</subsection>
