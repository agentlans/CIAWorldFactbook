   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Belize was the site of several Mayan city states until their
decline at the end of the first millennium A.D. The British and
Spanish disputed the region in the 17th and 18th centuries; it
formally became the colony of British Honduras in 1862. Territorial
disputes between the UK and Guatemala delayed the independence of
Belize until 1981. Guatemala refused to recognize the new nation
until 1992 and the two countries are involved in an ongoing border
dispute. Both nations have voted to send the dispute for final
resolution to the International Court of Justice. Tourism has
become the mainstay of the economy. Current concerns include the
country's heavy foreign debt burden, high crime rates, high
unemployment combined with a majority youth population, growing
involvement in the Mexican and South American drug trade, and one
of the highest HIV/AIDS prevalence rates in Central America.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Migration continues to transform Belize's population. About 16%
of Belizeans live abroad, while immigrants constitute approximately
15% of Belize's population. Belizeans seeking job and educational
opportunities have preferred to emigrate to the United States
rather than former colonizer Great Britain because of the United
States' closer proximity and stronger trade ties with Belize.
Belizeans also emigrate to Canada, Mexico, and English-speaking
Caribbean countries. The emigration of a large share of Creoles
(Afro-Belizeans) and the influx of Central American immigrants,
mainly Guatemalans, Salvadorans, and Hondurans, has changed
Belize's ethnic composition. Mestizos have become the largest
ethnic group, and Belize now has more native Spanish speakers than
English or Creole speakers, despite English being the official
language. In addition, Central American immigrants are establishing
new communities in rural areas, which contrasts with the
urbanization trend seen in neighboring countries. Recently,
Chinese, European, and North American immigrants have become more
frequent.Immigration accounts for an increasing share of Belize's
population growth rate, which is steadily falling due to fertility
decline. Belize's declining birth rate and its increased life
expectancy are creating an aging population. As the elderly
population grows and nuclear families replace extended households,
Belize's government will be challenged to balance a rising demand
for pensions, social services, and healthcare for its senior
citizens with the need to reduce poverty and social inequality and
to improve sanitation.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Flag description">royal blue with a narrow red stripe along the top and the bottom
edges; centered is a large white disk bearing the coat of arms; the
coat of arms features a shield flanked by two workers in front of a
mahogany tree with the related motto SUB UMBRA FLOREO (I Flourish
in the Shade) on a scroll at the bottom, all encircled by a green
garland of 50 mahogany leaves; the colors are those of the two main
political parties: blue for the PUP and red for the UDP; various
elements of the coat of arms - the figures, the tools, the mahogany
tree, and the garland of leaves - recall the logging industry that
led to British settlement of Belize

due to Guatemala’s claims to more than half of Belizean territory.
 Line of Adjacency operates in lieu of an international
boundary to control influx of Guatemalan squatters onto Belizean
territory. Smuggling, narcotics trafficking, and human trafficking
for sexual exploitation and debt bondage are all problems. Belize
lacks resources to detect and extradite impoverished Guatemalan
peasants squatting in Belizean rain forests in the remote border
areas. At present, Belize and Honduras 12-nm territorial sea claims
close off Guatemalan access to Caribbean in the Bahia de Amatique.
Maritime boundary remains unresolved pending further
negotiation.

Belize-Honduras: Honduras claims the Belizean-administered
Sapodilla Cays off the coast of Belize in its constitution, but
agreed to a joint ecological park around the cays should Guatemala
consent to a maritime corridor in the Caribbean under the
OAS-sponsored 2002 Belize-Guatemala Differendum.Belize-Mexico: Belize and Mexico are working to solve
minor border demarcation discrepancies arising from inaccuracies in
the 1898 border treaty. Transshipment of illegal narcotics,
smuggling, human trafficking, illegal immigration, and the growing
of marijuana in very low population areas are all issues in the
region today.</subsection>
