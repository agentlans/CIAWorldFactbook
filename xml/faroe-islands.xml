   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The population of the Faroe Islands, a self-governing dependency
of Denmark, is largely descended from Viking settlers who arrived
in the 9th century. The islands have been connected politically to
Denmark since the 14th century. The Home Rule Act of 1948 granted a
high degree of self-government to the Faroese, who have autonomy
over most internal affairs and external trade, while Denmark is
responsible for justice, defense, and some foreign affairs. The
Faroe Islands are not part of the European Union.</subsection>

highly developed communication network, which covers the whole
country; from telecommunication and mobile phones to the internet

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
