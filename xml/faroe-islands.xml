   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The population of the Faroe Islands, a self-governing dependency
of Denmark, is largely descended from Viking settlers who arrived
in the 9th century. The islands have been connected politically to
Denmark since the 14th century. The Home Rule Act of 1948 granted a
high degree of self-government to the Faroese, who have autonomy
over most internal affairs and external trade, while Denmark is
responsible for justice, defense, and some foreign affairs. The
Faroe Islands are not part of the European Union.</subsection>
