   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Central African Republic (CAR) is a perennially weak state
that sits at the crossroads of ethnic and linguistic groups in the
center of the African continent. Among the last areas of
Sub-Saharan Africa to be drawn into the world economy, its
introduction into trade networks around the early 1700s fostered
significant competition among its population. The local population
sought to benefit from the lucrative Atlantic, trans-Saharan, and
Indian Ocean trade in enslaved people and ivory. Slave raids aided
by the local populations fostered animosity between ethnic groups
that remains today. The territory was established as a French
colony named Ubangui-Shari in 1903, and France modeled its
administration of the colony after the Belgian Congo,
subcontracting control of the territory to private companies that
collected rubber and ivory. Although France banned the domestic
slave trade in CAR in the 1910s, the private companies continued to
exploit the population through forced labor. The colony of
Ubangi-Shari gained independence from France as the Central African
Republic in August 1960, but the death of independence leader
Barthelemy BOGANDA six months prior led to an immediate struggle
for power.CAR’s political history has since been marred by a series of
coups, the first of which brought Jean-Bedel BOKASSA to power in
1966. BOKASSA’s regime was characterized by widespread corruption
and an intolerance of opposition, which manifested in the
disappearances of many who challenged BOKASSA’s rule. In an effort
to prolong his mandate, he named himself emperor in 1976 and
changed the country’s name to the Central African Empire. His
regime’s economic mismanagement culminated in widespread student
protests in early 1979 that were violently suppressed by security
forces. BOKASSA, rumored to have participated in the killing of
some young students after the protests, fell out of favor with the
international community and was overthrown in a French-backed coup
in 1979. After BOKASSA’s departure, the country’s name once again
became the Central African Republic.CAR’s fifth coup in March 2013 unseated President Francois
BOZIZE after a mainly Muslim rebel coalition named the Seleka
seized the capital and forced BOZIZE, who himself had taken power
in a coup in 2003, to flee the country. Widespread abuses by the
Seleka spurred the formation of mainly Christian self-defense
groups that called themselves the anti-Balaka, which have also
committed human rights abuses against Muslim populations in
retaliation. Since the rise of the self-defense groups, conflict in
CAR has become increasingly ethnoreligious-based, although focused
on identity as opposed to religious ideology. Elections organized
by a transitional government in early 2016 installed independent
candidate Faustin-Archange TOUADERA as president; he was reelected
in December 2020. A peace agreement signed in February 2019 between
the government and the main armed factions has had little effect,
and armed groups remain in control of large swaths of the country's
territory.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">The Central African Republic’s (CAR) humanitarian crisis has
worsened since the coup of March 2013. CAR’s high mortality rate
and low life expectancy are attributed to elevated rates of
preventable and treatable diseases (including malaria and
malnutrition), an inadequate health care system, precarious food
security, and armed conflict. Some of the worst mortality rates are
in western CAR’s diamond mining region, which has been impoverished
because of government attempts to control the diamond trade and the
fall in industrial diamond prices. To make matters worse, the
government and international donors have reduced health funding in
recent years. The CAR’s weak educational system and low literacy
rate have also suffered as a result of the country’s ongoing
conflict. Schools are closed, qualified teachers are scarce,
infrastructure, funding, and supplies are lacking and subject to
looting, and many students and teachers have been displaced by
violence.Rampant poverty, human rights violations, unemployment, poor
infrastructure, and a lack of security and stability have led to
forced displacement internally and externally. Since the political
crisis that resulted in CAR’s March 2013 coup began in December
2012, approximately 600,000 people have fled to Chad, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and other neighboring countries,
while another estimated 515,000 were displaced internally as of
December 2022. The UN has urged countries to refrain from
repatriating CAR refugees amid the heightened lawlessness.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">given the poor fixed-line infrastructure in most countries across Africa, voice and data services across the region are greatly dependent on mobile networks; in the majority of markets, including those with better developed fixed infrastructure such as South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya, up to 98% of all voice and data connections are via mobile networks; during the last two to three years, national governments and telecom regulators have striven to improve fixed infrastructure with the wider aim of developing economic growth based on digital services and connectivity; this work is principally focused on delivering fiber-based connectivity; since the amount of copper infrastructure (DSL or HFC) used for broadband is so negligible, governments and private firms, including telcos are investing in fiber rather than in older technologies; while supporting broadband to premises, health centers, and government buildings, the new fiber infrastructure is mainly being deployed to provide mobile platforms and to support the rapid growth in data traffic (2022)</note>

      <subsection title="Military - note">the 2013 coup resulted in the institutional collapse of the
FACA; its forces were overwhelmed and forced to flee to neighboring
countries; it has been estimated that only 10% of the FACA returned
after the coup, and it has struggled to rebuild in the years of
instability since, despite considerable foreign assistance;
significant portions of the country remain outside state control
and are ungoverned, with the presence of multiple armed actors
creating insecurity in much of the country 

in 2018, the UN Security Council approved Russian security
assistance for the CAR to help train and advise FACA personnel, as
well as transport them to operational areas, provide logistical
support, and assist with medical evacuation; in addition to teams
of military trainers, Russia sent private military contractors, and
as of 2022, as many as 2,000 were providing assistance to the FACA,
as well as performing other security roles such as guarding mines
and government officials; some Russian contractors and the CAR
forces they supported have been accused of carrying out
indiscriminate killings, using excessive force against civilians,
and looting

the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the
Central African Republic (MINUSCA) has operated in the country
since 2014; its mission includes providing security, protecting
civilians, facilitating humanitarian assistance, disarming and
demobilizing armed groups, and supporting the country’s fragile
transitional government; as of 2022, MINUSCA had approximately
15,000 military and police personnel

the European Union Training Mission in the Central African Republic
(EUTM-RCA) has operated in the country since 2016, providing
advice, training, and educational programs to the country's
security forces; since 2016, the EU mission has trained 5
territorial infantry battalions and 1 amphibious infantry
battalion; the mission suspended operational training in 2021;
France also provided assistance to the FACA before suspending its
support, also in 2021 (2022)</subsection>
