   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The hunter-gatherer San people first inhabited the area that
eventually became Zimbabwe. Farming communities migrated to the
area around A.D. 500 during the Bantu expansion, and Shona-speaking
societies began to develop in the Limpopo valley and Zimbabwean
highlands around the 9th century. These societies traded with Arab
merchants on the Indian Ocean coast and organized under the Kingdom
of Mapungubwe in the 11th century. A series of powerful
trade-oriented Shona states succeeded Mapungubwe, including the
Kingdom of Zimbabwe (ca. 1220-1450), Kingdom of Mutapa (ca.
1450-1760), and the Rozwi Empire. The Rozwi Empire expelled
Portuguese colonists from the Zimbabwean plateau but was eventually
conquered in 1838 by the Ndebele clan of Zulu general MZILIKAZI
during the era of conflict and population displacement known as the
Mfecane. In the 1880s, colonists arrived with the British South
Africa Company (BSAC) and obtained a written concession for mining
rights from Ndebele King LOBENGULA. The king later disavowed the
concession and accused the BSAC agents of deceit. The BSAC annexed
Mashonaland and subsequently conquered Matabeleland by force during
the First Matabele War of 1893-1894 to establish company rule over
the territory. BSAC holdings south of the Zambezi River were
annexed by the UK in 1923 and became the British colony of Southern
Rhodesia. The 1930 Land Apportionment Act restricted Black land
ownership and established structural racial inequalities that would
favor the White minority for decades. A new constitution in 1961
further cemented White minority rule.

In 1965, the government under White Prime Minister Ian SMITH
unilaterally declared its independence from the UK. London did not
recognize Rhodesia’s independence and demanded more voting rights
for the Black majority in the country. International diplomacy and
a liberation struggle by Black Zimbabweans finally led to biracial
elections in 1979 and independence (as Zimbabwe) in 1980. Robert
MUGABE, who led the uprising and became the nation's first prime
minister, was the country's only ruler (as president since 1987)
from independence until his forced resignation in November 2017. In
the mid-1980s, the government tortured and killed thousands of
civilians in a crackdown on dissent known as the Gukurahundi
campaign. Economic mismanagement and chaotic land redistribution
policies following independence periodically crippled the economy
and resulted in widespread shortages of basic commodities. General
elections in 2002, 2008, and 2013 were severely flawed and widely
condemned but allowed MUGABE to remain president. In November 2017,
Vice President Emmerson MNANGAGWA became president following a
military intervention that forced MUGABE to resign, and MNANGAGWA
cemented power by sidelining rivals Grace MUGABE (Robert MUGABE’s
wife) and Jonathan MOYO of the G40 faction of the ruling Zimbabwe
African National Union-Patriotic Front party. In July 2018,
MNANGAGWA won the presidential election after a close contest with
opposition candidate Nelson CHAMISA. MNANGAGWA has resorted to the
government's longstanding practice of violently disrupting protests
and opposition rallies. Economic conditions remained dire under
MNANGAGWA, with inflation soaring in 2019 and the country’s export
revenues declining dramatically in 2020 due to the COVID-19
pandemic.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Zimbabwe’s progress in reproductive, maternal, and child health
has stagnated in recent years. According to a 2010 Demographic and
Health Survey, contraceptive use, the number of births attended by
skilled practitioners, and child mortality have either stalled or
somewhat deteriorated since the mid-2000s. Zimbabwe’s total
fertility rate has remained fairly stable at about 4 children per
woman for the last two decades, although an uptick in the urban
birth rate in recent years has caused a slight rise in the
country’s overall fertility rate. Zimbabwe’s HIV prevalence rate
dropped from approximately 29% to 15% since 1997 but remains among
the world’s highest and continues to suppress the country’s life
expectancy rate. The proliferation of HIV/AIDS information and
prevention programs and personal experience with those suffering or
dying from the disease have helped to change sexual behavior and
reduce the epidemic.Historically, the vast majority of Zimbabwe’s migration has been
internal – a rural-urban flow. In terms of international migration,
over the last 40 years Zimbabwe has gradually shifted from being a
destination country to one of emigration and, to a lesser degree,
one of transit (for East African illegal migrants traveling to
South Africa). As a British colony, Zimbabwe attracted significant
numbers of permanent immigrants from the UK and other European
countries, as well as temporary economic migrants from Malawi,
Mozambique, and Zambia. Although Zimbabweans have migrated to South
Africa since the beginning of the 20th century to work as miners,
the first major exodus from the country occurred in the years
before and after independence in 1980. The outward migration was
politically and racially influenced; a large share of the white
population of European origin chose to leave rather than live under
a new black-majority government.In the 1990s and 2000s, economic mismanagement and
hyperinflation sparked a second, more diverse wave of emigration.
This massive outmigration – primarily to other southern African
countries, the UK, and the US – has created a variety of
challenges, including brain drain, illegal migration, and human
smuggling and trafficking. Several factors have pushed highly
skilled workers to go abroad, including unemployment, lower wages,
a lack of resources, and few opportunities for career growth.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">Zimbabwe’s telcos continue to be affected by the country’s poor economy; this has been exacerbated by the significant economic difficulties related to the pandemic; revenue has also been under pressure from a number of recent regulatory measures and additional taxes imposed by the cash-strapped government; inflation has become so high that year-on-year revenue comparisons since 2019 have been difficult to assess meaningfully; the three MNOs continue to invest in network upgrades, partly supported by government efforts and cash released from the Universal Service Fund; as a result of these investments, LTE networks have expanded steadily, though services remain concentrated in urban areas; international bandwidth has improved since fiber links to several submarine cables were established via neighboring countries; the expansion of 3G and LTE-based mobile broadband services has meant that most of the population has access to the internet; the government has started a national broadband scheme aimed at delivering a 1Mb/s service nationally by 2030; investment in fixed broadband infrastructure has also resulted in a slow but steady growth in the number of DSL connections, and also fiber subscriptions; during 2021, most growth in the fixed broadband segment has been with fiber connections (2022)</note>
         <note title="domestic">consists of microwave radio relay links, open-wire lines, radiotelephone communication stations, fixed wireless local loop installations, fiber-optic cable, VSAT terminals, and a substantial mobile-cellular network; Internet connection is most readily available in Harare and major towns; two government owned and two private cellular providers; fixed-line teledensity at nearly 2 per 100 and mobile-cellular nearly 89 per 100 (2020)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>

between Botswana and Zambia to build a bridge over the Zambezi
River, thereby de facto recognizing a short, but not clearly
delimited, Botswana-Zambia boundary in the river; in May 2021,
Botswana and Zambia agreed in principle to let Zimbabwe be a
partner in the bridge project as it enters its lasts phase</subsection>

      <subsection title="Trafficking in persons">
         <note title="tier rating">Tier 3 - Zimbabwe does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so; the government passed an anti-trafficking law in 2014 defining trafficking in persons as a crime of transportation and failing to capture the key element of the international definition of human trafficking – the purpose of exploitation – which prevents the law from being comprehensive or consistent with the 2000 UN TIP Protocol that Zimbabwe acceded to in 2013; the government did not report on anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts during 2014, and corruption in law enforcement and the judiciary remain a concern; authorities made minimal efforts to identify and protect trafficking victims, relying on NGOs to identify and assist victims; Zimbabwe’s 2014 anti-trafficking law required the opening of 10 centers for trafficking victims, but none were established during the year; five existing shelters for vulnerable children and orphans may have accommodated child victims; in January 2015, an inter-ministerial anti-trafficking committee was established, but it is unclear if the committee ever met or initiated any activities (2015)</note>
         <note title="trafficking profile">Zimbabwe is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking; Zimbabwean women and girls from towns bordering South Africa, Mozambique, and Zambia are subjected to forced labor, including domestic servitude, and prostitution catering to long-distance truck drivers; Zimbabwean men, women, and children experience forced labor in agriculture and domestic servitude in rural areas; family members may recruit children and other relatives from rural areas with promises of work or education in cities and towns where they end up in domestic servitude and sex trafficking; Zimbabwean women and men are lured into exploitative labor situations in South Africa and other neighboring countries</note>
