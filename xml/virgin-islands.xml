   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Danes secured control over the southern Virgin Islands of
Saint Thomas, Saint John, and Saint Croix during the 17th and early
18th centuries. Sugarcane, produced by African slave labor, drove
the islands' economy during the 18th and early 19th centuries. In
1917, the US purchased the Danish holdings, which had been in
economic decline since the abolition of slavery in 1848. On 6
September 2017, Hurricane Irma passed over the northern Virgin
Islands of Saint Thomas and Saint John and inflicted severe damage
to structures, roads, the airport on Saint Thomas, communications,
and electricity. Less than two weeks later, Hurricane Maria passed
over the island of Saint Croix in the southern Virgin Islands,
inflicting considerable damage with heavy winds and flooding
rains.</subsection>

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
