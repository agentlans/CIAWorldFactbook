   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Berbers have inhabited central north Africa since ancient times,
but the region has been settled and ruled by Phoenicians, Greeks,
Carthaginians, Persians, Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and Vandals. In
the the 7th century, Islam spread through the region; in the
mid-16th century, Ottoman rule began. The Italians supplanted the
Ottoman Turks in the area around Tripoli in 1911 and did not
relinquish their hold until 1943 when they were defeated in World
War II. Libya then passed to UN administration and achieved
independence in 1951. Following a 1969 military coup, Col. Muammar
al-QADHAFI assumed leadership and began to espouse his political
system at home, which was a combination of socialism and Islam.
During the 1970s, QADHAFI used oil revenues to promote his ideology
outside Libya, supporting subversive and terrorist activities that
included the downing of two airliners - one over Scotland, another
in Northern Africa - and a discotheque bombing in Berlin. UN
sanctions in 1992 isolated QADHAFI politically and economically
following the attacks; sanctions were lifted in 2003 following
Libyan acceptance of responsibility for the bombings and agreement
to claimant compensation. QADHAFI also agreed to end Libya's
program to develop weapons of mass destruction, and he made
significant strides in normalizing relations with Western
nations.Unrest that began in several Middle Eastern and North African
countries in late 2010 erupted in Libyan cities in early 2011.
QADHAFI's brutal crackdown on protesters spawned an eight-month
civil war that saw the emergence of a National Transitional Council
(NTC), UN authorization of air and naval intervention by the
international community, and the toppling of the QADHAFI regime. In
2012, the NTC handed power to an elected parliament, the General
National Congress (GNC). Voters chose a new parliament to replace
the GNC in June 2014 - the House of Representatives (HoR) - which
relocated to the eastern city of Tobruk after fighting broke out in
Tripoli and Benghazi in July 2014.In December 2015, the UN brokered an agreement among a broad
array of Libyan political parties and social groups - known as the
Libyan Political Agreement (LPA) - establishing an interim
executive body, the Government of National Accord (GNA). However,
the HoR and defunct-GNC-affiliated political hardliners continued
to oppose the GNA and hamper the LPA’s implementation, leaving
Libya with eastern and western-based rival governments. In
September 2017, UN Special Representative Ghassan SALAME announced
a new roadmap for national political reconciliation. In November
2018, the international community supported SALAME’s recalibrated
Action Plan for Libya that aimed to break the political deadlock by
holding a National Conference in early 2019. These plans, however,
were derailed when the eastern-based self-described Libyan National
Army (LNA) launched an offensive to seize Tripoli in April 2019.
Several countries sent armed personnel and advanced military
equipment into Libya. The LNA's offensive collapsed in June 2020,
and a subsequent UN-sponsored cease-fire in October 2020 helped
formalize the pause in fighting between rival camps, although
foreign forces, fighters, and mercenaries that aided eastern and
western factions during the fighting remain in Libya.<br/>
         <br/>
In early 2021, the UN-facilitated Libyan Political Dialogue Forum
selected a new prime minister for an interim government, the
Government of National Unity (GNU), and a new presidential council
charged with preparing for presidential and parliamentary elections
in December 2021 and uniting the country’s state institutions. The
HoR approved the GNU and its cabinet in March 2021, providing Libya
with its first unified government since 2014. On 22 December 2021,
Libya's parliament postponed the first round of the presidential
election to an undetermined date in the future. Talks in June 2022
failed to reach agreement on eligibility requirements for
presidential candidates.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Despite continuing unrest, Libya remains a destination country
for economic migrants. It is also a hub for transit migration to
Europe because of its proximity to southern Europe and its lax
border controls. Labor migrants have been drawn to Libya since the
development of its oil sector in the 1960s. Until the latter part
of the 1990s, most migrants to Libya were Arab (primarily Egyptians
and Sudanese). However, international isolation stemming from
Libya’s involvement in international terrorism and a perceived lack
of support from Arab countries led QADHAFI in 1998 to adopt a
decade-long pan-African policy that enabled large numbers of
Sub-Saharan migrants to enter Libya without visas to work in the
construction and agricultural industries. Although Sub-Saharan
Africans provided a cheap labor source, they were poorly treated
and were subjected to periodic mass expulsions.By the mid-2000s, domestic animosity toward African migrants and
a desire to reintegrate into the international community motivated
QADHAFI to impose entry visas on Arab and African immigrants and to
agree to joint maritime patrols and migrant repatriations with
Italy, the main recipient of illegal migrants departing Libya. As
his regime neared collapse in 2011, QADHAFI reversed his policy of
cooperating with Italy to curb illegal migration and sent boats
loaded with migrants and asylum seekers to strain European
resources. Libya’s 2011 revolution decreased immigration
drastically and prompted nearly 800,000 migrants to flee to third
countries, mainly Tunisia and Egypt, or to their countries of
origin. The inflow of migrants declined in 2012 but returned to
normal levels by 2013, despite continued hostility toward
Sub-Saharan Africans and a less-inviting job market.While Libya is not an appealing destination for migrants, since
2014, transiting migrants – primarily from East and West Africa –
continue to exploit its political instability and weak border
controls and use it as a primary departure area to migrate across
the central Mediterranean to Europe in growing numbers. In
addition, approximately 135,000 people were displaced internally as
of  August 2022 by fighting between armed groups in eastern
and western Libya and, to a lesser extent, by inter-tribal clashes
in the country’s south.</subsection>

Tripolitana by the Romans, meaning "region of the three cities" -
namely Oea (i.e., modern Tripoli), Sabratha (to the west), and
Leptis Magna (to the east); over time, the shortened name of
"Tripoli" came to refer to just Oea, which derives from the Greek
words tria and polis meaning "three cities"</subsection>
