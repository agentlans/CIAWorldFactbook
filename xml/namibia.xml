   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Various ethnic groups occupied southwestern Africa prior to
Germany establishing a colony over most of the territory in 1884.
South Africa occupied the colony, then known as German South West
Africa, in 1915 during World War I and administered it as a mandate
until after World War II, when it annexed the territory.  In
1966, the Marxist South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)
guerrilla group launched a war of independence for the area that
became Namibia, but it was not until 1988 that South Africa agreed
to end its administration in accordance with a UN peace plan for
the entire region. Namibia gained independence in 1990 and has been
governed by SWAPO since, though the party has dropped much of its
Marxist ideology. President Hage GEINGOB was elected in 2014 in a
landslide victory, replacing Hifikepunye POHAMBA who stepped down
after serving two terms. SWAPO retained its parliamentary super
majority in the 2014 elections. In 2019 elections, GEINGOB was
reelected but by a substantially reduced majority and SWAPO
narrowly lost its super majority in parliament. </subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Planning officials view Namibia’s reduced population growth rate
as sustainable based on the country’s economic growth over the past
decade. Prior to independence in 1990, Namibia’s relatively small
population grew at about 3% annually, but declining fertility and
the impact of HIV/AIDS slowed this growth to 1.4% by 2011,
rebounding to close to 2% by 2016. Namibia’s fertility rate has
fallen over the last two decades – from about 4.5 children per
woman in 1996 to 3.4 in 2016 and to 3 in 2022 – due to increased
contraceptive use, higher educational attainment among women, and
greater female participation in the labor force. The average age at
first birth has stayed fairly constant, but the age at first
marriage continues to increase, indicating a rising incidence of
premarital childbearing.The majority of Namibians are rural dwellers (about 55%) and
live in the better-watered north and northeast parts of the
country. Migration, historically male-dominated, generally flows
from northern communal areas – non-agricultural lands where blacks
were sequestered under the apartheid system – to agricultural,
mining, and manufacturing centers in the center and south. After
independence from South Africa, restrictions on internal movement
eased, and rural-urban migration increased, bolstering urban
growth.Some Namibians – usually persons who are better-educated, more
affluent, and from urban areas – continue to legally migrate to
South Africa temporarily to visit family and friends and, much less
frequently, to pursue tertiary education or better economic
opportunities. Namibians concentrated along the country’s other
borders make unauthorized visits to Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, or
Botswana, to visit family and to trade agricultural goods. Few
Namibians express interest in permanently settling in other
countries; they prefer the safety of their homeland, have a strong
national identity, and enjoy a well-supplied retail sector.
Although Namibia is receptive to foreign investment and
cross-border trade, intolerance toward non-citizens is
widespread.</subsection>
