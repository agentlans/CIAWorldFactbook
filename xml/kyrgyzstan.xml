   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">A Central Asian country of incredible natural beauty and proud
nomadic traditions, most of the territory of present-day Kyrgyzstan
was formally annexed by the Russian Empire in 1876. The Kyrgyz
staged a major revolt against the Tsarist Empire in 1916 in which
almost one-sixth of the Kyrgyz population was killed. Kyrgyzstan
became a Soviet republic in 1926 and achieved independence in 1991
when the USSR dissolved. Nationwide demonstrations in 2005 and 2010
resulted in the ouster of the country’s first two presidents, Askar
AKAEV and Kurmanbek BAKIEV. Interim President Roza OTUNBAEVA led a
transitional government and following a nation-wide election,
President Almazbek ATAMBAEV was sworn in as president in 2011. In
2017, ATAMBAEV became the first Kyrgyzstani president to step down
after serving one full six-year term as required in the country’s
constitution. Former prime minister and ruling Social-Democratic
Party of Kyrgyzstan member, Sooronbay JEENBEKOV, replaced him after
winning the 2017 presidential election, which was the most
competitive in the country’s history, although international and
local election observers noted cases of vote buying and abuse of
public resources. In October 2020, protests against legislative
election results spread across Kyrgyzstan, leading to JEENBEKOV’s
resignation from the presidency, and catapulting previously
imprisoned Sadyr JAPAROV to acting president. In January 2021,
Kyrgyzstanis formerly elected JAPAROV as president and approved a
referendum to move Kyrgyzstan from a parliamentary to a
presidential system. In April 2021, Kyrgyzstanis voted in favor of
draft constitutional changes that consolidated power in the
presidency. Pro-government parties won a majority in the Jogorku
Kenesh (Kyrgyzstan’s legislature) in November 2021 elections.
Continuing concerns for Kyrgyzstan include the trajectory of
democratization, endemic corruption, a history of tense, and at
times violent, interethnic relations, border security
vulnerabilities, and potential terrorist threats.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Kyrgyzstan is a sparsely populated country whose population is
unevenly distributed.  More than 50% of the population lives
in or around the two cities of Bishkek and Osh and their
surrounding districts, which together account for about 12% of the
country’s area.  Kyrgyzstan’s population continues to grow
rapidly owing to its high fertility rate and the traditional
preference for larger families, a low mortality rate, a growing
share of women of reproductive age, and measures to support
families with children. The country has a youthful age structure;
over 45% of the population is under the age of 25 as of 2022. 
Nevertheless, Kyrgyzstan is transitioning from an agricultural
society with high fertility and mortality rates to an industrial
society with lower fertility and mortality rates.As part of the USSR, Kyrgyzstan’s rapid population growth was
not problematic because its needs were redistributed among the
Soviet States.  As an independent state, however, population
growth became burdensome.  International labor migration
continues to serve as a safety valve that decreases pressure on the
labor market and resources (healthcare, education, and pensions),
while also reducing poverty through much-needed remittances. 
The main destinations for labor migrants are Russia and Kazakhstan,
where wages are higher; almost a third of Kyrgyzstan’s working-age
population migrates to Russia alone.  Outmigration was most
pronounced in the 1990s, after the collapse of the USSR, when
ethnic Russians, Ukrainians, and Germans left Kyrgyzstan, changing
the proportion of ethnic Kyrgyz in the country from barely 50% in
1992 to almost three-quarters today.While Kyrgyzstan is a net emigration country, it does receive
immigrants.  The majority of immigrants are from the
Commonwealth of Independent States – particularly Kazakhstan,
Russia, and Uzbekistan – but more recent arrivals also include
persons from China, Turkey, and Turkmenistan.  Chinese
immigrants work primarily in construction and gold mining, while
Turkish immigrants mainly work in construction, trade, education,
and services.  Border areas between Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan,
and Uzbekistan experience irregular migration, but many of these
migrants plan to move on to Europe.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: the country’s telecom
sector (specifically the mobile segment) has been able to prosper;
Kyrgyzstan has opened up its telecom market to competition; the
mobile market has achieved high levels of penetration (140% in
2021) along with a fairly competitive operating environment with
four major players; mobile broadband has come along strongly,
reaching over 125% penetration in 2019 before falling back slightly
during the Covid-19 crisis; slow-to-moderate growth is expected for
both segments in coming years, supported by the anticipated rollout
of 5G services starting from late 2022 (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line penetration at nearly 5 per
100 persons remains low and concentrated in urban areas;
mobile-cellular subscribership up to over 130 per 100 persons
(2020)<br/>

international: country code - 996; connections
with other CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States, 9 members
post-Soviet Republics in EU) countries by landline or microwave
radio relay and with other countries by leased connections with
Moscow international gateway switch and by satellite; satellite
earth stations - 2 (1 Intersputnik, 1 Intelsat) (2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

was offset by Uzbekistan retaining use of reservoirs on Kyrgyz

agreement had not been reached on all border segments</subsection>
