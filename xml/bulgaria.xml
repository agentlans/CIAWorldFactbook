   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Bulgars, a Central Asian Turkic tribe, merged with the local
Slavic inhabitants in the late 7th century to form the first
Bulgarian state. In succeeding centuries, Bulgaria struggled with
the Byzantine Empire to assert its place in the Balkans, but by the
end of the 14th century the country was overrun by the Ottoman
Turks. Northern Bulgaria attained autonomy in 1878 and all of
Bulgaria became independent from the Ottoman Empire in 1908. Having
fought on the losing side in both World Wars, Bulgaria fell within
the Soviet sphere of influence and became a People's Republic in
1946. Communist domination ended in 1990, when Bulgaria held its
first multiparty election since World War II and began the
contentious process of moving toward political democracy and a
market economy while combating inflation, unemployment, corruption,
and crime. The country joined NATO in 2004 and the EU in 2007.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment"/>Bulgaria’s telecom market was for some years affected by the
difficult macroeconomic climate, as well as by relatively high
unemployment and a shrinking population; these factors continue to
slow investments in the sector, though revenue growth has returned
since 2019; there still remains pressure on revenue growth, with
consumers migrating from fixed-line voice telephony to mobile and
VoIP alternatives, while the volume of SMS and MMS traffic has been
affected by the growing use of alternative OTT messaging services;
investing in network upgrades and its development of services based
on 5G have stimulated other market players to invest in their own
service provision; by the end of 2022 about 70% of the population
is expected to be covered by 5G; the broadband market in Bulgaria
enjoys excellent cross-platform competition; the share of the
market held by DSL has fallen steadily as a result of customers
being migrated to fiber networks; by early 2021 about 65% of
fixed-line broadband subscribers were on fiber infrastructure;
Bulgaria joins the U.S. State Department’s Clean Network initiative
in a bid to protect its 5G communications networks<note title="domestic">fixed-line over 13 per 100 persons, mobile-cellular teledensity, fostered by multiple service providers, is over 114 telephones per 100 persons (2020)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>
