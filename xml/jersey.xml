   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Jersey and the other Channel Islands represent the last remnants
of the medieval Duchy of Normandy that held sway in both France and
England. These islands were the only British soil occupied by
German troops in World War II. The Bailiwick of Jersey is a British
Crown dependency, which means that it is not part of the UK but is
rather a self-governing possession of the British Crown. However,
the UK Government is constitutionally responsible for its defense
and international representation.</subsection>
