   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Strategically important, Gibraltar was reluctantly ceded to
Great Britain by Spain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht; the British
garrison was formally declared a colony in 1830. In a referendum
held in 1967, Gibraltarians voted overwhelmingly to remain a
British dependency. The subsequent granting of autonomy in 1969 by
the UK led Spain to close the border and sever all communication
links. Between 1997 and 2002, the UK and Spain held a series of
talks on establishing temporary joint sovereignty over Gibraltar.
In response to these talks, the Gibraltar Government called a
referendum in late 2002 in which the majority of citizens voted
overwhelmingly against any sharing of sovereignty with Spain. Since
late 2004, Spain, the UK, and Gibraltar have held tripartite talks
with the aim of cooperatively resolving problems that affect the
local population, and work continues on cooperation agreements in
areas such as taxation and financial services; communications and
maritime security; policy; legal and customs services;
environmental protection; and education and visa services. A new
noncolonial constitution came into force in 2007, and the European
Court of First Instance recognized Gibraltar's right to regulate
its own tax regime in December 2008. The UK retains responsibility
for defense, foreign relations, internal security, and financial
stability.Spain and the UK continue to spar over the territory. Throughout
2009, a dispute over Gibraltar's claim to territorial waters
extending out three miles gave rise to periodic non-violent
maritime confrontations between Spanish and UK naval patrols, and
in 2013, the British reported a record number of entries by Spanish
vessels into waters claimed by Gibraltar following a dispute over
Gibraltar's creation of an artificial reef in those waters. Spain
renewed its demands for an eventual return of Gibraltar to Spanish
control after the UK’s June 2016 vote to leave the EU, but London
has dismissed any connection between the vote and its continued
sovereignty over Gibraltar. </subsection>
