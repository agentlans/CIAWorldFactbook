   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">With 28 ethnic groups and languages, Liberia is one of the most
ethnically diverse countries in the world. For hundreds of years,
the Mali and Songhai Empires claimed most of Liberia. Beginning in
the 15th century, European traders began establishing outposts
along the Liberian coast. Unlike its neighbors, however, Liberia
did not fall under European colonial rule. In the early 19th
century, the US began sending freed enslaved people and other
people of color to Liberia to establish settlements. In 1847, these
settlers declared independence from the US, writing their own
constitution and establishing Africa’s first republic.Early in Liberia’s history, tensions arose between the
Americo-Liberian settlers and the indigenous population. In 1980,
Samuel DOE, who was from the indigenous population, led a military
coup and ushered in a decade of authoritarian rule. In December
1989, Charles TAYLOR launched a rebellion against DOE's regime that
led to a prolonged civil war in which DOE was killed. A period of
relative peace in 1997 permitted an election that brought TAYLOR to
power. In 2000, fighting resumed. An August 2003 peace agreement
ended the war and prompted President TAYLOR’s resignation. TAYLOR
was later convicted by the UN-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone
in The Hague for his involvement in Sierra Leone's civil war. In
late 2005, President Ellen JOHNSON SIRLEAF became president after
two years of transitional governments; she was the first female
head of state in Africa. In 2011, JOHNSON SIRLEAF won reelection
but struggled to rebuild Liberia's economy, particularly following
the 2014-15 Ebola epidemic, and to reconcile a nation still
recovering from 14 years of fighting. In 2017, former soccer star
George WEAH won the presidential runoff election, marking the first
successful transfer of power from one democratically elected
government to another since the end of Liberia’s civil wars. Like
his predecessor, WEAH has struggled to improve the country’s
economy. The next presidential election is scheduled for 2023. </subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Liberia’s high fertility rate of nearly 5 children per woman and
large youth cohort – more than 60% of the population is under the
age of 25 as of 2020 – will sustain a high dependency ratio for
many years to come. Significant progress has been made in
preventing child deaths, despite a lack of health care workers and
infrastructure. Infant and child mortality have dropped nearly 70%
since 1990; the annual reduction rate of about 5.4% is the highest
in Africa.Nevertheless, Liberia’s high maternal mortality rate remains
among the world’s worst; it reflects a high unmet need for family
planning services, frequency of early childbearing, lack of quality
obstetric care, high adolescent fertility, and a low proportion of
births attended by a medical professional. Female mortality is also
increased by the prevalence of female genital cutting (FGC), which
is practiced by 10 of Liberia’s 16 tribes and affects more than
two-thirds of women and girls. FGC is an initiation ritual
performed in rural bush schools, which teach traditional beliefs on
marriage and motherhood and are an obstacle to formal classroom
education for Liberian girls.Liberia has been both a source and a destination for refugees.
During Liberia’s 14-year civil war (1989-2003), more than 250,000
people became refugees and another half million were internally
displaced. Between 2004 and the cessation of refugee status for
Liberians in June 2012, the UNHCR helped more than 155,000
Liberians to voluntarily repatriate, while others returned home on
their own. Some Liberian refugees spent more than two decades
living in other West African countries. Between 2011 and 2022, more
than 300,000 Ivoirian refugees in Liberia have been repatriated; as
of year-end 2022, less than 2,300 Ivoirian refugees were still
living in Liberia.</subsection>

note: on 21 March 2022, the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Travel Alert for polio in
Africa; Liberia is currently considered a high risk to travelers
for circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV);
vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) is a strain of the weakened
poliovirus that was initially included in oral polio vaccine (OPV)
and that has changed over time and behaves more like the wild
or naturally occurring virus; this means it can be spread more
easily to people who are unvaccinated against polio and who come in
contact with the stool or respiratory secretions, such as from a
sneeze, of an “infected” person who received oral polio vaccine;
the CDC recommends that before any international travel, anyone
unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated, or with an unknown polio
vaccination status should complete the routine polio vaccine
series; before travel to any high-risk destination, the CDC
recommends that adults who previously completed the full, routine
polio vaccine series receive a single, lifetime booster dose of

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Liberia has a telecom
market which is mainly based on mobile networks; this is due to the
civil war which destroyed much of the fixed-line infrastructure; to
facilitate LTC Mobile’s market entry, the government in January
2022 set in train amendments to telecom legislation; internet
services are available from a number of wireless ISPs as well as
the mobile operators; the high cost and limited bandwidth of
connections means that internet access is expensive and rates are
very low; additional bandwidth is available from an international
submarine cable but considerable investment is still needed in
domestic fixed-line infrastructure before end-users can make full
use of the cable (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line less than 1 per 100;
mobile-cellular subscription base growing and teledensity
approached 33 per 100 persons (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 231; landing point
for the ACE submarine cable linking 20 West African
countries and Europe; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat
(Atlantic Ocean) (2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

      <subsection title="Military - note">the AFL is responsible for external defense but also has some
domestic security responsibilities if called upon, such as
humanitarian assistance during natural disasters and support to law
enforcement; it is a small, lightly equipped force comprised of 2
combat infantry battalions and supporting units; the infantry
battalions were rebuilt with US assistance in 2007-2008 from the
restructured AFL following the end of the second civil war in 2003
when military and police forces were disbanded and approximately
100,000 military, police, and rebel combatants were disarmed<br/>
         <br/>
the first militia unit established for defense of the colony was
raised in 1832; the AFL traces its origins to the 1908
establishment of the Liberia Frontier Force, which became the
Liberian National Guard in 1965; the AFL was established in
1970<br/>
         <br/>
the UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) was established in 2003 as a
peacekeeping force; at its height, UNMIL was comprised of about
15,000 personnel, including more than 3,000 troops absorbed from
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) peacekeeping
mission; Liberian forces reassumed full control of the country’s
security in June of 2016, and the UNMIL mission was ended in 2018

      <subsection title="Maritime threats">the International Maritime Bureau reports the territorial and
offshore waters in the Niger Delta and Gulf of Guinea remain a very
high risk for piracy and armed robbery of ships; in 2021, there
were 34 reported incidents of piracy and armed robbery at sea in
the Gulf of Guinea region; although a significant decrease from the
total number of 81 incidents in 2020, it included the one hijacking
and three of five ships fired upon worldwide; while boarding and
attempted boarding to steal valuables from ships and crews are the
most common types of incidents, almost a third of all incidents
involve a hijacking and/or kidnapping; in 2021, 57 crew members
were kidnapped in seven separate incidents in the Gulf of Guinea,
representing 100% of kidnappings worldwide; Nigerian pirates in
particular are well armed and very aggressive, operating as far as
200 nm offshore; the Maritime Administration of the US Department
of Transportation has issued a Maritime Advisory (2022-001 - Gulf
of Guinea-Piracy/Armed Robbery/Kidnapping for Ransom) effective 4
January 2022, which states in part, "Piracy, armed robbery, and
kidnapping for ransom continue to serve as significant threats to
US-flagged vessels transiting or operating in the Gulf of
Guinea"</subsection>
