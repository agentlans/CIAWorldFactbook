   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">An ancient crossroads for various migrations, Uganda has as many
as 65 ethnic groups that speak languages from three of Africa’s
four major linguistic families. As early as 1200, fertile soils and
regular rainfall in the south fostered the formation of several
large centralized kingdoms, including Buganda, from which the
country derives its name. Muslim traders from Egypt reached
northern Uganda in the 1820s, and Swahili merchants from the Indian
Ocean coast arrived in the south by the 1840s. The area attracted
the attention of British explorers seeking the source of the Nile
River in the 1860s, and this influence expanded in subsequent
decades with the arrival of Christian missionaries and trade
agreements; Uganda was declared a British protectorate in 1894.
Buganda and other southern kingdoms negotiated agreements with
Britain to secure privileges and a level of autonomy that were rare
during the colonial period in Africa. The colonial boundaries
demarcating Uganda grouped together a wide range of ethnic groups
with different political systems and cultures, and the disparities
between how Britain governed southern and northern areas compounded
these differences, complicating efforts to establish a cohesive
independent country.<br/>
         <br/>
Uganda gained independence in 1962 with one of the more developed
economies and one of the strongest education systems in Sub-Saharan
Africa, but it descended within a few years into political turmoil
and internal conflict that lasted more than two decades. In 1966,
Prime Minister Milton OBOTE suspended the constitution and
violently deposed President Edward MUTESA, who was also the king of
Buganda. Idi AMIN seized power in 1971 through a military coup and
led the country into economic ruin and rampant mass atrocities that
killed as many as 500,000 civilians. AMIN’s annexation of Tanzanian
territory in 1979 provoked Tanzania to invade Uganda, depose AMIN,
and install a coalition government. In the aftermath, Uganda
continued to experience atrocities, looting, and political
instability and had four different heads of state between 1979 and
1980. OBOTE regained the presidency in 1980 through a controversial
election that sparked renewed guerrilla warfare, killing as an
estimated 300,000 civilians. Gen. Tito OKELLO seized power in a
coup in 1985, but his rule was short-lived, with Yoweri MUSEVENI
becoming president in 1986 after his insurgency captured the
capital. MUSEVENI is widely credited with restoring relative
stability and economic growth to Uganda but has resisted calls to
leave office. In 2017, parliament approved the removal of
presidential age limits, making it possible for MUSEVENI to remain
in office for life. Uganda faces numerous challenges that could
affect future stability, including explosive population growth,
power and infrastructure constraints, corruption, underdeveloped
democratic institutions, and human rights deficits.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Uganda has one of the youngest and most rapidly growing
populations in the world; its total fertility rate is among the
world’s highest at close to 5.5 children per woman in 2022. Except
in urban areas, actual fertility exceeds women’s desired fertility
by one or two children, which is indicative of the widespread unmet
need for contraception, lack of government support for family
planning, and a cultural preference for large families. High
numbers of births, short birth intervals, and the early age of
childbearing contribute to Uganda’s high maternal mortality rate.
Gender inequities also make fertility reduction difficult; women on
average are less-educated, participate less in paid employment, and
often have little say in decisions over childbearing and their own
reproductive health. However, even if the birth rate were
significantly reduced, Uganda’s large pool of women entering
reproductive age ensures rapid population growth for decades to
come.Unchecked, population increase will further strain the
availability of arable land and natural resources and overwhelm the
country’s limited means for providing food, employment, education,
health care, housing, and basic services. The country’s north and
northeast lag even further behind developmentally than the rest of
the country as a result of long-term conflict (the Ugandan Bush War
1981-1986 and more than 20 years of fighting between the Lord’s
Resistance Army (LRA) and Ugandan Government forces), ongoing
inter-communal violence, and periodic natural disasters.Uganda has been both a source of refugees and migrants and a
host country for refugees. In 1972, then President Idi AMIN, in his
drive to return Uganda to Ugandans, expelled the South Asian
population that composed a large share of the country’s business
people and bankers. Since the 1970s, thousands of Ugandans have
emigrated, mainly to southern Africa or the West, for security
reasons, to escape poverty, to search for jobs, and for access to
natural resources. The emigration of Ugandan doctors and nurses due
to low wages is a particular concern given the country’s shortage
of skilled health care workers. Africans escaping conflicts in
neighboring states have found refuge in Uganda since the 1950s; the
country currently struggles to host tens of thousands from the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan, and other nearby
countries.</subsection>

note 1: on 18 November 2022, the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued an updated Travel Alert
for polio in Africa; Uganda is currently considered a high risk to
travelers for circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV);
vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) is a strain of the weakened
poliovirus that was initially included in oral polio vaccine (OPV)
and that has changed over time and behaves more like the wild
or naturally occurring virus; this means it can be spread more
easily to people who are unvaccinated against polio and who come in
contact with the stool or respiratory secretions, such as from a
sneeze, of an “infected” person who received oral polio vaccine;
the CDC recommends that before any international travel, anyone
unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated, or with an unknown polio
vaccination status should complete the routine polio vaccine
series; before travel to any high-risk destination, the CDC
recommends that adults who previously completed the full, routine
polio vaccine series receive a single, lifetime booster dose of
polio vaccine<br/>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: a series of reforms within
Uganda’s telecom sector have provided the country with one of the
most competitive markets in the region; in line with the
regulator’s licensing requirements by which Uganda-based companies
should be broadly owned by Ugandans by mid-2022; fixed-line
infrastructure remains poor, with low penetration, and as a result
fixed-line broadband penetration is also particularly low;
consumers have largely depended on mobile infrastructure to provide
voice and broadband services; there is sufficient capacity with LTE
infrastructure to match data demand during the next few years;
Uganda has anticipated the migration to 5G, having held trials in
early 2020 though the roll out of 5G is not expected until later in
2022 (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line less than 1 per 100 and
mobile cellular systems teledensity about 61 per 100 persons;

international: country code - 256; satellite earth

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

as of 2022, the UPDF was conducting operations along the border
with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (including cross-border
operations) against a Congo-based (and formerly based in western
Uganda) Ugandan rebel group, the Allied Democratic Front (ADF),
which was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the US
in March 2021 as the Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (ISIS-DRC; see Appendix T); in
addition, elements of the UPDF were deployed in the northeast
region of Karamoja against cattle rustlers and criminal gangs<br/>
         <br/>
beginning in 2012, the UPDF led regional efforts to pursue the
Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), a small, violent group of Ugandan
origin that conducted widespread attacks against civilians in much
of Central Africa; the UPDF withdrew from the mission in 2017 after
declaring that the LRA no longer posed a security threat; Uganda
intervened in the South Sudan civil war in 2013-2016 and UPDF
forces have clashed with South Sudanese forces along the border as
recently as 2020<br/>
         <br/>
the military traces its history back to the formation of the Uganda
Rifles in 1895 under the British colonial government; the Uganda
Rifles were merged with the Central Africa Regiment and the East
Africa Rifles to form the King’s African Rifles (KAR) in 1902,
which participated in both world wars, as well as the Mau Mau
rebellion in Kenya (1952-1960); in 1962, the Ugandan battalion of
the KAR was transformed into the country's first military force,
the Uganda Rifles, which was subsequently renamed the Uganda Army;
the Uganda People's Defense Force was established in 1995 from the
former rebel National Resistance Army following the enactment of
the 1995 Constitution of Uganda (2022)</subsection>
