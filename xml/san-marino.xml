   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Geographically the third-smallest state in Europe (after the
Holy See and Monaco), San Marino also claims to be the world's
oldest republic. According to tradition, it was founded by a
Christian stonemason named MARINUS in A.D. 301. San Marino's
foreign policy is aligned with that of the EU, although it is not a
member; social and political trends in the republic track closely
with those of its larger neighbor, Italy.</subsection>
