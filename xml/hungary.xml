   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Hungary became a Christian kingdom in A.D. 1000 and for many
centuries served as a bulwark against Ottoman Turkish expansion in
Europe. The kingdom eventually became part of the polyglot
Austro-Hungarian Empire, which collapsed during World War I. The
country fell under communist rule following World War II. In 1956,
a revolt and an announced withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact were met
with a massive military intervention by Moscow. Under the
leadership of Janos KADAR in 1968, Hungary began liberalizing its
economy, introducing so-called "Goulash Communism." Hungary held
its first multiparty elections in 1990 and initiated a free market
economy. It joined NATO in 1999 and the EU five years later.</subsection>

flag dates to the national movement of the 18th and 19th centuries,
and fuses the medieval colors of the Hungarian coat of arms with
the revolutionary tricolor form of the French flag; folklore
attributes virtues to the colors: red for strength, white for
faithfulness, and green for hope; alternatively, the red is seen as
being for the blood spilled in defense of the land, white for
freedom, and green for the pasturelands that make up so much of the

         <note title="general assessment">Hungary benefits from having a developed telecom infrastructure, with a focus among operators to develop the 5G sector and upgrade fixed networks to provide a 1Gb/s service; services based on 5G have been supported by the January 2021 multi-spectrum auction for spectrum in the 900MHz and 1800MHz bands; the number of fixed-lines continues to fall as subscribers migrate to the mobile platform for voice and data services; operators have looked to bundled packages to boost revenue and retain subscribers; the broadband market has effective infrastructure-based competition, with an extensive cable network competing against DSL services and a vibrant and rapidly expanding fiber sector; the regulator has also introduced a number of measures aimed at promoting market competition, which is pushing the drive for higher speed platforms and encouraging operators to invest in technology upgrades; as a result, Hungary now has the highest fixed broadband penetration rate in Eastern Europe; the number of super fast broadband connections (above 30Mb/s) accounted for 78% of all fixed broadband connections (2022)</note>
         <note title="domestic">competition among mobile-cellular service providers has led to a sharp increase in the use of mobile-cellular phones, and a decrease in the number of fixed-line connections, with just under 31 fixed per 100 persons and 107 mobile-cellular subscriptions per 100 (2020)</note>
         <note title="international">country code - 36; Hungary has fiber-optic cable connections with all neighboring countries; the international switch is in Budapest; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean regions), 1 Inmarsat, 1 (very small aperture terminal) VSAT system of ground terminals</note>
         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>
