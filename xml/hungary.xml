   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Hungary became a Christian kingdom in A.D. 1000 and for many
centuries served as a bulwark against Ottoman Turkish expansion in
Europe. The kingdom eventually became part of the polyglot
Austro-Hungarian Empire, which collapsed during World War I. The
country fell under communist rule following World War II. In 1956,
a revolt and an announced withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact were met
with a massive military intervention by Moscow. Under the
leadership of Janos KADAR in 1968, Hungary began liberalizing its
economy, introducing so-called "Goulash Communism." Hungary held
its first multiparty elections in 1990 and initiated a free market
economy. It joined NATO in 1999 and the EU five years later.</subsection>

etymology: the Byzantine Greeks refered to the

etymology: the Hungarian capital city was formed
in 1873 from the merger of three cities on opposite banks of the
Danube: Buda and Obuda (Old Buda) on the western shore and Pest on
the eastern; the origins of the original names are obscure, but
according to the second century A.D. geographer, Ptolemy, the
settlement that would become Pest was called "Pession" in ancient
times; "Buda" may derive from either a Slavic or Turkic personal
name</subsection>

flag dates to the national movement of the 18th and 19th centuries,

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Hungary benefits from
having a developed telecom infrastructure, with a focus among
operators to develop the 5G sector and upgrade fixed networks to
provide a 1Gb/s service; services based on 5G have been supported
by the January 2021 multi-spectrum auction for spectrum in the
900MHz and 1800MHz bands; the number of fixed-lines continues to
fall as subscribers migrate to the mobile platform for voice and
data services; operators have looked to bundled packages to boost
revenue and retain subscribers; the broadband market has effective
infrastructure-based competition, with an extensive cable network
competing against DSL services and a vibrant and rapidly expanding
fiber sector; the regulator has also introduced a number of
measures aimed at promoting market competition, which is pushing
the drive for higher speed platforms and encouraging operators to
invest in technology upgrades; as a result, Hungary now has the
highest fixed broadband penetration rate in Eastern Europe; the
number of super fast broadband connections (above 30Mb/s) accounted
for 78% of all fixed broadband connections (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: competition among mobile-cellular
service providers has led to a sharp increase in the use of
mobile-cellular phones, and a decrease in the number of fixed-line
connections, with just under 31 fixed per 100 persons and 107
mobile-cellular subscriptions per 100 (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 36; Hungary has
fiber-optic cable connections with all neighboring countries; the
international switch is in Budapest; satellite earth stations - 2
Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean regions), 1 Inmarsat, 1
(very small aperture terminal) VSAT system of ground
terminals<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
