   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The inhabitants of the area of Oman have long prospered from
Indian Ocean trade. In the late 18th century, the nascent sultanate
in Muscat signed the first in a series of friendship treaties with
Britain. Over time, Oman's dependence on British political and
military advisors increased, although the sultanate never became a
British colony. In 1970, QABOOS bin Said Al-Said overthrew his
father, and ruled as sultan for the next five decades. His
extensive modernization program opened the country to the outside
world. He prioritized strategic ties with the UK and US, and his
moderate, independent foreign policy allowed Oman to maintain good
relations with its neighbors and to avoid external
entanglements.

Inspired by the popular uprisings that swept the Middle East and
North Africa beginning in January 2011, some Omanis staged
demonstrations, calling for more jobs and economic benefits and an
end to corruption. In response to those protester demands, QABOOS
in 2011 pledged to implement economic and political reforms, such
as granting Oman’s bicameral legislative body more power and
authorizing direct elections for its lower house, which took place
in November 2011. Additionally, the sultan increased unemployment
benefits, and, in August 2012, issued a royal directive mandating
the speedy implementation of a national job creation plan for
thousands of public and private sector Omani jobs. As part of the
government's efforts to decentralize authority and allow greater
citizen participation in local governance, Oman successfully
conducted its first municipal council elections in December 2012.
Announced by the sultan in 2011, the municipal councils have the
power to advise the Royal Court on the needs of local districts
across Oman's 11 governorates. Sultan QABOOS, Oman's longest
reigning monarch, died on 11 January 2020. His cousin, HAYTHAM bin
Tariq bin Taimur Al-Said, former Minister of Heritage and Culture,
was sworn in as Oman's new sultan the same day.</subsection>
