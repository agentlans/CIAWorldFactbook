   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The inhabitants of the area of Oman have long prospered from
Indian Ocean trade. In the late 18th century, the nascent sultanate
in Muscat signed the first in a series of friendship treaties with
Britain. Over time, Oman's dependence on British political and
military advisors increased, although the sultanate never became a
British colony. In 1970, QABOOS bin Said Al-Said overthrew his
father, and ruled as sultan for the next five decades. His
extensive modernization program opened the country to the outside
world. He prioritized strategic ties with the UK and US, and his
moderate, independent foreign policy allowed Oman to maintain good
relations with its neighbors and to avoid external
entanglements.<br/>
         <br/>
Inspired by the popular uprisings that swept the Middle East and
North Africa beginning in January 2011, some Omanis staged
demonstrations, calling for more jobs and economic benefits and an
end to corruption. In response to those protester demands, QABOOS
in 2011 pledged to implement economic and political reforms, such
as granting Oman’s bicameral legislative body more power and
authorizing direct elections for its lower house, which took place
in November 2011. Additionally, the sultan increased unemployment
benefits, and, in August 2012, issued a royal directive mandating
the speedy implementation of a national job creation plan for
thousands of public and private sector Omani jobs. As part of the
government's efforts to decentralize authority and allow greater
citizen participation in local governance, Oman successfully
conducted its first municipal council elections in December 2012.
Announced by the sultan in 2011, the municipal councils have the
power to advise the Royal Court on the needs of local districts
across Oman's 11 governorates. Sultan QABOOS, Oman's longest
reigning monarch, died on 11 January 2020. His cousin, HAYTHAM bin
Tariq bin Taimur Al-Said, former Minister of Heritage and Culture,
was sworn in as Oman's new sultan the same day.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Oman has a modern mobile
sector which comprises substantial coverage of both 3G and LTE
networks; in February 2021 commercial 5G services were launched;
the Covid-19 pandemic has caused a spike in mobile data traffic;
while Oman’s fixed broadband infrastructure penetration is
considered low, it is being improved with the building of
fiber-based networks as part of Oman’s Vision 2040 program; Oman
has also established itself as an important communications hub in
the Middle East, with access to numerous submarine cables including
the 2Africa submarine cable, which should become available during
2023-2024; the 9,800km Oman Australia Cable running from Muscat to
Perth, with the potential for a branch line to Djibouti, is making
progress and is expected to be completed in December 2021; this
additional infrastructure will provide considerable additional
bandwidth (2021)<br/>

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
