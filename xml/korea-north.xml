   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The first recorded kingdom (Choson) on the Korean Peninsula
dates from approximately 2300 B.C.  Over the subsequent
centuries, three main kingdoms - Kogoryo, Paekche, and Silla - were
established on the Peninsula. By the 5th century A.D.,
Kogoryo emerged as the most powerful, with control over much of the
Peninsula, as well as part of Manchuria (modern-day northeast
China). However, Silla allied with the Chinese to create the first
unified Korean state in the late 7th century (688).
Following the collapse of Silla in the 9th century,
Korea was unified under the Koryo (Goryeo; 918-1392) and the Chosen
(Joseon; 1392-1910) dynasties.Korea became the object of intense imperialistic rivalry between
the Chinese (its traditional benefactor), Japanese, and Russian
empires in the latter half of the 19th and early 20th
centuries.  Following the Sino-Japanese War (1894-95) and the
Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), Korea was occupied by Imperial Japan.
In 1910, Japan formally annexed the entire peninsula. After World
War II, Korea was split with the northern half coming under
Soviet-sponsored communist control. After the Korean War (1950-53),
during which North Korea failed to conquer UN-backed South Korea
(Republic of Korea, ROK), North Korea (Democratic People’s Republic
of Korea, DPRK), under its founder President KIM Il Sung, adopted a
policy of juche ("self-reliance") as a check against
outside influence. North Korea demonized the US as the ultimate
threat to its social system through state-funded propaganda, and
molded political, economic, and military policies around the core
ideological objective of eventual unification of Korea under
Pyongyang's control. KIM Il Sung's son, KIM Jong Il, was officially
designated as his father's successor in 1980, assuming a growing
political and managerial role until the elder KIM's death in 1994.
Under KIM Jong Il's reign, North Korea continued developing nuclear
weapons and ballistic missiles. KIM Jong Un was publicly unveiled
as his father's successor in 2010. Following KIM Jong Il's death in
2011, KIM Jong Un quickly assumed power and has since occupied the
regime's highest political and military posts. After decades of economic mismanagement and resource
misallocation, the North since the mid-1990s has faced chronic food
shortages and economic stagnation. In recent years, the North's
domestic agricultural production has increased, but still falls far
short of producing sufficient food to provide for its entire
population. Starting in 2002, North Korea began to ease
restrictions to allow semi-private markets but has made few other
efforts to meet its goal of improving the overall standard of
living. New economic development plans in the 2010s failed to meet
government-mandated goals for key industrial sectors, food
production, or overall economic performance. In response, the North
Korean leader in 2021 admitted these failures, but vowed to
continue "self-reliant" policies.

North Korea has a history of provocative regional military actions
and posturing that are of major concern to the international
community and have limited North Korea’s international engagement,
particularly economically. These include proliferation of
military-related items; long-range missile development; WMD
programs including tests of nuclear devices in 2006, 2009, 2013,
2016, and 2017; and large conventional armed forces. In 2013, North
Korea declared a policy of simultaneous development of its nuclear
weapons program and economy. In late 2017, KIM Jong Un declared the
North's nuclear weapons development complete. In 2018, KIM
announced a pivot towards diplomacy, including a re-prioritization
of economic development, a pause in missile testing beginning in
late 2017, and a refrain from anti-US rhetoric starting in June
2018. However, despite high-level efforts to ease tensions during
the 2018-19 timeframe, including summits with the leaders of China,
South Korea, and the US, North Korea in recent years has continued
developing its ballistic missile program and issued statements
condemning the US, and vowing to further strengthen its military
capabilities, including long range missiles and nuclear weapons.
North Korea remains one of the world’s most isolated and one of
Asia’s poorest countries.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">following years of isolationism and economic under-achievement, North Korea languishes near the bottom of the world’s telecom maturity index alongside Afghanistan and Turkmenistan (who also happen to be struggling under repressive political regimes); the obstacles to building a functioning telecom network are so numerous that a fixed-line segment barely exists; mobile communication is estimated to have eased up slightly to reach 19% in 2021, yet the high cost of ownership coupled with strict censorship makes mobile communications the exclusive domain of senior government officials and diplomats; for those citizens living close to China, it has been possible to obtain Chinese handsets and SIM cards, and to connect to towers (illegally) located just across the border; while this offers access to the outside world and at much lower prices than the state-controlled offerings, the risks are high including steep fines and the possibility of jail time; North Korea has been slightly more effective in building an IT sector and a nascent digital economy on the back of a concerted effort to grow a sizeable, well-trained IT workforce; but even here, its capabilities have been directed more towards nefarious activities such as cyber crime and hacking into Western countries’ computer systems; North Korea’s determination to put itself offside with the rest of the world in pursuit of its ideology can only lead to tighter controls on communications inside and outside of the country (2022)</note>

      <subsection title="Military expenditures">between 2010 and 2019, military expenditures accounted for an

including cybercrime — to generate revenue for its weapons of mass
destruction and ballistic missile programs to evade US and UN
sanctions</subsection>
      <subsection title="Military and security service personnel strengths">information varies widely; estimated 1.15 million active troops
(950,000 Army; 120,000 Air Force; 60,000 Navy; 10,000 Strategic

(2022)</subsection>
      <subsection title="Military equipment inventories and acquisitions">the KPA is equipped with older weapon systems originally
acquired from the former Soviet Union, Russia, and China, and some
domestically produced equipment; North Korea produces a diverse
array of military hardware, including small arms, munitions, light
armored vehicles, tanks, naval vessels and submarines, and some
advanced weapons systems, such as cruise and ballistic missiles;
most are copies or upgrades of older foreign supplied equipment
(2022)
<note title="note">since 2006, the UN Security Council has passed nearly a dozen resolutions sanctioning North Korea for developing nuclear weapons and related activities, starting with Resolution 1718, which condemned the North's first nuclear test and placed sanctions on the supply of heavy weaponry (including tanks, armored combat vehicles, large calibre artillery, combat aircraft, attack helicopters, warships, and missiles and missile launchers), missile technology and material, and select luxury goods; additional resolutions have expanded to include all arms, including small arms and light weapons; the US and other countries have also imposed unilateral sanctions</note>

      </subsection>
      <subsection title="Military - note">in addition to the invasion of South Korea and the subsequent
Korean War (1950-53), North Korea from the 1960s to the 1980s
launched a considerable number of limited military and subversive
actions against South Korea using special forces and terrorist
tactics; including aggressive skirmishes along the DMZ, overt
attempts to assassinate South Korean leaders, kidnappings, the
bombing of an airliner, and a failed effort in 1968 to foment an
insurrection and conduct a guerrilla war in the South with more
than 100 seaborne commandos; from the 1990s until 2010, the North
lost two submarines and a semi-submersible boat attempting to
insert infiltrators into the South (1996, 1998) and provoked
several engagements in the Northwest Islands area along the
disputed Northern Limit Line (NLL), including naval skirmishes
between patrol boats in 1999 and 2002, the torpedoing and sinking
of a South Korean Navy corvette in 2010, and the bombardment of a
South Korean Marine Corps installation on Yeonpyeong Island, also
in 2010; since 2010, further minor incidents continue to occur
periodically along the DMZ, where both the KPA and the South Korean
military maintain large numbers of troops

in 2018, North Korea and South Korea signed a tension reduction
agreement known as the Comprehensive Military Agreement (CMA),
which established land, sea, and air buffer zones along the DMZ and
the NLL; implementation of the CMA required the removal of some
land mines and guard posts; the efforts led to a reduction of
tension in the DMZ, but as of 2022 North Korea had failed to uphold
much of its side of the agreement

the KPA was founded in 1948; Kim Jong Un is the KPA supreme
commander, while operational control of the armed forces resides in
the General Staff Department (GSD), which reports directly to Kim;
the GSD maintains overall control of all military forces and is
charged with turning Kim’s directives into operational military
orders; the Ministry of National Defense (MND) is responsible for
administrative control of the military and external relations with
foreign militaries

as of 2022, North Korea’s growing ballistic missile program
included close- (CRBM), short- (SRBM), medium- (MRBM),
intermediate- (IRBM), and intercontinental- (ICBM) range ballistic
missiles; the North received its first ballistic missiles,
short-range FROGs (free rocket over ground), from the Soviet Union
in the 1960s, but its modern ballistic missile program is generally
thought to date back to the mid-1970s when it received a Soviet
Scud-class missile, likely from Egypt; the North reverse-engineered
the missile and developed an indigenously built version in 1984; it
flight-tested its first Scud-based medium-range Nodong missile in
1990, and probably began development of the multi-stage Taepodong
missiles around this time as well; the North revealed its first
road-mobile ICBM in 2012 and conducted the first test of an
ICBM-class system in 2017; it conducted additional ICBM tests in
2022 (2022)</subsection>
