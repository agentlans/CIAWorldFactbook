   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Resistance by native Caribs prevented colonization on Saint
Vincent until 1719. Disputed by France and the UK for most of the
18th century, the island was ceded to the latter in 1783. The
British prized Saint Vincent due to its fertile soil, which allowed
for thriving slave-run plantations of sugar, coffee, indigo,
tobacco, cotton, and cocoa. In 1834, the British abolished slavery.
Immigration of indentured servants eased the ensuing labor
shortage, as did subsequent Portuguese immigrants from Madeira and
East Indian laborers. Conditions remained harsh for both former
slaves and immigrant agricultural workers, however, as depressed
world sugar prices kept the economy stagnant until the early 1900s.
The economy then went into a period of decline with many landowners
abandoning their estates and leaving the land to be cultivated by
liberated slaves. Between 1960 and 1962, Saint Vincent and the
Grenadines was a separate administrative unit of the Federation of
the West Indies. Autonomy was granted in 1969 and independence in
1979. In April 2021, the explosive eruption of the La Soufrière
volcano in the north of Saint Vincent destroyed much of Saint
Vincent’s most productive agricultural lands. Unlike most of its
tourism-dependent neighbors, the Vincentian economy is primarily
agricultural. The US provided $4.7 million in humanitarian support
after the eruption.</subsection>
