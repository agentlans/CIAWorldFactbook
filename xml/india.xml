   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Indus Valley civilization, one of the world's oldest,
flourished during the 3rd and 2nd millennia B.C. and extended into
northwestern India. Aryan tribes from the northwest infiltrated the
Indian subcontinent about 1500 B.C.; their merger with the earlier
Dravidian inhabitants created the classical Indian culture. The
Maurya Empire of the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C. - which reached its
zenith under ASHOKA - united much of South Asia. The Golden Age
ushered in by the Gupta dynasty (4th to 6th centuries A.D.) saw a
flowering of Indian science, art, and culture. Islam spread across
the subcontinent over a period of 700 years. In the 10th and 11th
centuries, Turks and Afghans invaded India and established the
Delhi Sultanate. In the early 16th century, the Emperor BABUR
established the Mughal Dynasty, which ruled India for more than
three centuries. European explorers began establishing footholds in
India during the 16th century.By the 19th century, Great Britain had become the dominant
political power on the subcontinent and India was seen as the
"Jewel in the Crown" of the British Empire. The British Indian Army
played a vital role in both World Wars. Years of nonviolent
resistance to British rule, led by Mohandas GANDHI and Jawaharlal
NEHRU, eventually resulted in Indian independence in 1947.
Large-scale communal violence took place before and after the
subcontinent partition into two separate states - India and
Pakistan. The neighboring countries have fought three wars since
independence, the last of which was in 1971 and resulted in East
Pakistan becoming the separate nation of Bangladesh. India's
nuclear weapons tests in 1998 emboldened Pakistan to conduct its
own tests that same year. In November 2008, terrorists originating
from Pakistan conducted a series of coordinated attacks in Mumbai,
India's financial capital. India's economic growth following the
launch of economic reforms in 1991, a massive youthful population,
and a strategic geographic location have contributed to India's
emergence as a regional and global power. However, India still
faces pressing problems such as environmental degradation,
extensive poverty, and widespread corruption, and its restrictive
business climate challenges economic growth expectations.</subsection>

etymology: the city's name is associated with
various myths and legends; the original name for the city may have
been Dhilli or Dhillika; alternatively, the name could be a
corruption of the Hindustani words "dehleez" or "dehali" - both
terms meaning "threshold" or "gateway" - and indicative of the city
as a gateway to the Gangetic Plain; after the British decided to
move the capital of their Indian Empire from Calcutta to Delhi in
1911, they created a new governmental district south of the latter
designated as New Delhi; the new capital was not formally
inaugurated until 1931</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: India’s telecommunications
sector has struggled for growth over the last five years; the
sector’s lackluster performance has been in spite of concerted
efforts by the government to bolster the underlying infrastructure
in a bid to achieve universal coverage; instead, the country’s
relatively liberal regulatory environment has encouraged fierce
competition and price wars among the operators; State-owned as well
as private operators have been forced to seek redress from the
government in order to avoid bankruptcy; one particular area of
contention has been the billions owed by the operators to the
government in the form of Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) dues – usage
and licensing fees charged by the Department of Telecommunications
(DoT) – that have been the subject of long-standing court battles
over what should be counted as revenue; the government won that
battle in the Supreme Court in 2019, but the financial impairment
of that decision has pushed a number of telcos to the brink; add
the impact of the Covid-19 crisis in 2020 and 2021 to the mix, and
the government had to come to the industry’s rescue by introducing
a major reform package in September 2021; along with changes to the
definition of AGR with regard to non-telecom revenue, the package
includes a four-year moratorium on AGR dues and spectrum
instalments; the government has also deferred the spectrum auctions
for 5G until later in 2022; mobile spectrum in India is already in
short supply in terms of providing the necessary capacity to reach
universal coverage, but the cash-strapped MNOs may not yet be in a
sufficiently strong financial position for which to make the 5G
spectrum auction viable (2022)<br/>

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

China and Pakistan; the short 1962 Sino-India War left in place one
of the world’s longest disputed international borders, resulting in
occasional standoffs between Indian and Chinese security forces,
including lethal clashes in 1975 and 2020; meanwhile, India and
Pakistan have fought several conflicts since 1947, including the
Indo-Pakistan War of 1965 and the Indo-Pakistan and Bangladesh War
of Independence of 1971, as well as two clashes over the disputed
region of Kashmir (the First Kashmir War of 1947 and the 1999
Kargil Conflict); a fragile cease-fire in Kashmir was reached in
2003, revised in 2018, and reaffirmed in 2021, although the Line of
Control remained contested as of 2022, and India has accused
Pakistan of backing armed separatists and terrorist organizations
in Jammu and Kashmir where Indian forces have conducted
counterinsurgency operations since the 1980s; in addition, India
and Pakistan have battled over the Siachen Glacier of Kashmir,
which was seized by India in 1984 with Pakistan attempting to
retake the area at least three times between 1985 and 1995; despite
a cease-fire, as of 2022 both sides continued to maintain a
permanent military presence there with outposts at altitudes above
20,000 feet (over 6,000 meters) where most casualties were due to
extreme weather and the hazards of operating in the high mountain
