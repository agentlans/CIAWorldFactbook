   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">In the first half of the second millennium A.D., northern
Mozambican port towns were frequented by traders from Somalia,
Ethiopia, Egypt, Arabia, Persia, and India. The Portuguese were
able to wrest much of the coastal trade from Arab Muslims in the
centuries after 1500 and to set up their own colonies. Portugal did
not relinquish Mozambique until 1975. Large-scale emigration,
economic dependence on South Africa, a severe drought, and a
prolonged civil war hindered the country's development until the
mid-1990s. The ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique
(FRELIMO) party formally abandoned Marxism in 1989, and a new
constitution the following year provided for multiparty elections
and a free market economy. A UN-negotiated peace agreement between
FRELIMO and rebel Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO) forces
ended the fighting in 1992. In 2004, Mozambique underwent a
delicate transition as Joaquim CHISSANO stepped down after 18 years
in office. His elected successor, Armando GUEBUZA, served two terms
and then passed executive power to Filipe NYUSI in 2015. RENAMO’s
residual armed forces intermittently engaged in a low-level
insurgency after 2012, but a late December 2016 cease-fire
eventually led to the two sides signing a comprehensive peace deal
in August 2019. Elections in October 2019, challenged by Western
observers and civil society as being problematic, resulted in
resounding wins for NYUSI and FRELIMO across the country. Since
October 2017, violent extremists - who an official ISIS media
outlet recognized as ISIS's network in Mozambique for the first
time in June 2019 - have been conducting attacks against civilians
and security services in the northern province of Cabo Delgado. In
2021, Rwanda and the Southern African Development Community
deployed forces to support Mozambique’s efforts to counter the
extremist group.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Mozambique is a poor, sparsely populated country with high
fertility and mortality rates and a rapidly growing youthful
population – 45% of the population is younger than 15, as of 2020.
Mozambique’s high poverty rate is sustained by natural disasters,
disease, high population growth, low agricultural productivity, and
the unequal distribution of wealth. The country’s birth rate is
among the world’s highest, averaging around  5 children per
woman (and higher in rural areas) for at least the last three
decades. The sustained high level of fertility reflects gender
inequality, low contraceptive use, early marriages and
childbearing, and a lack of education, particularly among women.
The high population growth rate is somewhat restrained by the
country’s high HIV/AIDS and overall mortality rates. Mozambique
ranks among the worst in the world for HIV/AIDS prevalence,
HIV/AIDS deaths, and life expectancy at birth, as of 2022.Mozambique is predominantly a country of emigration, but
internal, rural-urban migration has begun to grow. Mozambicans,
primarily from the country’s southern region, have been migrating
to South Africa for work for more than a century. Additionally,
approximately 1.7 million Mozambicans fled to Malawi, South Africa,
and other neighboring countries between 1979 and 1992 to escape
from civil war. Labor migrants have usually been men from rural
areas whose crops have failed or who are unemployed and have headed
to South Africa to work as miners; multiple generations of the same
family often become miners. Since the abolition of apartheid in
South Africa in 1991, other job opportunities have opened to
Mozambicans, including in the informal and manufacturing sectors,
but mining remains their main source of employment.</subsection>

note: on 21 March 2022, the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Travel Alert for polio in
Africa; Mozambique is currently considered a high risk to travelers
for circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV);
vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) is a strain of the weakened
poliovirus that was initially included in oral polio vaccine (OPV)
and that has changed over time and behaves more like the wild
or naturally occurring virus; this means it can be spread more
easily to people who are unvaccinated against polio and who come in
contact with the stool or respiratory secretions, such as from a
sneeze, of an “infected” person who received oral polio vaccine;
the CDC recommends that before any international travel, anyone
unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated, or with an unknown polio
vaccination status should complete the routine polio vaccine
series; before travel to any high-risk destination, the CDC
recommends that adults who previously completed the full, routine
polio vaccine series receive a single, lifetime booster dose of

downturn - the number of people in need of food assistance is
expected to rise above the 1.86 million estimated in 2021-2022
because of three key factors; firstly, higher year‑on‑year prices
of food and fuel are reducing households’ purchasing power,
worsening their economic access to food, particularly for
low-income households; secondly, the impact of extreme weather
events on agricultural production in central and southern provinces
in 2022 is likely to mean that farming households in the affected
areas have both low food supplies from their own production and
curtailed income-earning opportunities from crop sales, impinging
on their food availability and economic access to food; thirdly,
there has been an increase in attacks by non‑state armed groups in

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: one of the first countries
in the region to embark upon telecom reform and to open the sector
to competition; the mobile segment in particular has shown strong
growth; additional competition followed in late 2020; a new
licensing regime ensured that by mid-2019 all operators had been
provided with universal licenses, enabling them to offer all types
of telephony and data services; mobile, fixed-line and broadband
penetration rates remain far below the average for the region; in
recent years the government has enforced the registration of SIM
cards, but with varying success; at the end of 2016 almost five
million unregistered SIM cards were deactivated but poor monitoring
meant that the process was revisited in mid-2019 and again in late
2020; the high cost of international bandwidth had long hampered
internet use, though the landing of two international submarine
cables (SEACOM and EASSy) has reduced the cost of bandwidth and so
led to drastic reductions in broadband retail prices as well as a
significant jump in available bandwidth; there is some
cross-platform competition, with DSL, cable, fibre, WiMAX, and
mobile broadband options available, though fixed broadband options
can be limited to urban areas; improvements can be expected from
the ongoing rollout of a national fiber backbone networks and of
upgrades to mobile infrastructure (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: extremely low fixed-line teledensity
contrasts with rapid growth in the mobile-cellular network;
operators provide coverage that includes all the main cities and
key roads; fixed-line less than 1 per 100 and nearly 49 per 100
mobile-cellular teledensity (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 258; landing points
for the EASSy and SEACOM/ Tata TGN-Eurasia fiber-optic submarine
cable systems linking numerous east African countries,
the Middle East and Asia ; satellite earth stations - 5
Intelsat (2 Atlantic Ocean and 3 Indian Ocean); TdM contracts for
Itelsat for satellite broadband and bulk haul services (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

      <subsection title="Military - note">the FADM is responsible for external security, cooperating with
police on internal security, and responding to natural disasters
and other emergencies; the current primary focus of the FADM is
countering an insurgency driven by militants with ties to the
Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS) terrorist group in the
northern province of Cabo Delgado, an area known for rich liquid
natural gas deposits; insurgent attacks in the province began in
2017 and the fighting has left over 4,000 estimated dead and
approximately 1 million displaced; the FADM is widely assessed as
lacking the training, equipment, and overall capabilities to
address the insurgency; as of 2022, several countries from the
Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) and the EU, as well as
Rwanda and the US were providing various forms of military
assistance; the SADC countries and Zambia have sent more than 3,000
military and security personnel, while the EU and the US have
provided training assistance; the counterterrorism efforts of the
Mozambique and allied African military and security forces have
seen some success against the militants, but as of 2022 terrorist
attacks had expanded into the neighboring provinces of Niassa and
Nampula (2023)</subsection>
