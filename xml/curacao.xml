   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The original Arawak Indian settlers who arrived on the island
from South America in about A.D. 1000, were largely enslaved by the
Spanish early in the 16th century and forcibly relocated to other
colonies where labor was needed. Curacao was seized by the Dutch
from the Spanish in 1634. Once the center of the Caribbean slave
trade, Curacao was hard hit economically by the Dutch abolition of
slavery in 1863. Its prosperity (and that of neighboring Aruba) was
restored in the early 20th century with the construction of the
Isla Refineria to service the newly discovered Venezuelan
oilfields. In 1954, Curacao and several other Dutch Caribbean
colonies were reorganized as the Netherlands Antilles, part of the
Kingdom of the Netherlands. In referenda in 2005 and 2009, the
citizens of Curacao voted to become a self-governing country within
the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The change in status became
effective in October 2010 with the dissolution of the Netherlands
Antilles.</subsection>
