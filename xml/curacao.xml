      <subsection title="Background">The original Arawak Indian settlers who arrived on the island
from South America in about A.D. 1000, were largely enslaved by the
Spanish early in the 16th century and forcibly relocated to other
colonies where labor was needed. Curacao was seized by the Dutch
from the Spanish in 1634. Once the center of the Caribbean slave
trade, Curacao was hard hit economically by the Dutch abolition of
slavery in 1863. Its prosperity (and that of neighboring Aruba) was
restored in the early 20th century with the construction of the
Isla Refineria to service the newly discovered Venezuelan
oilfields. In 1954, Curacao and several other Dutch Caribbean
colonies were reorganized as the Netherlands Antilles, part of the
Kingdom of the Netherlands. In referenda in 2005 and 2009, the
citizens of Curacao voted to become a self-governing country within
the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The change in status became
effective in October 2010 with the dissolution of the Netherlands
Antilles.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: fully automatic modern
telecommunications system; telecom sector across the Caribbean
region continues to be one ofÂ the growth areas; given the lack
of economic diversity in the region, with a high dependence on
tourism and activities such as fisheries and offshore financial
services the telecom sector contributes greatly to the GDP
(2020)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: roughly 33 per 100 users for fixed-line
and 111 per 100 users for cellular-mobile, majority of the
islanders have Internet; market revenue has been affected in recent
quarters as a result of competition and regulatory measures on
termination rates and roaming tariffs (2020)<br/>

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of
trafficking but it is making significant efforts to do so; the
government prosecuted and convicted more traffickers than in the
previous reporting period; however, authorities identified fewer
victims, and assistance to victims was contingent upon their
cooperation with law enforcement in prosecuting traffickers;
victims who were in the country illegally, including Venezuelans,
were at risk of deportation if they did not participate in trials
against their traffickers; the government did not operate centers
for trafficking victims but provided some funding to NGOs and
international organizations to care for victims (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
trafficking profile: human traffickers exploit
domestic and foreign victims in Curacao; undocumented migrants,
including the growing population of Venezuelans, are vulnerable to
sex and labor trafficking; Curacaoan and foreign women and girls,
mostly Dominican and Venezuelan, are exploited in sex trafficking;
migrants from other Caribbean countries, South America, China, and
India are subject to forced labor in construction, domestic
servitude, landscaping, minimarkets, retail, and restaurants</subsection>
