   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Aboriginal Australians arrived on the continent at least 60,000
years ago and developed complex hunter-gatherer societies and oral
histories. Dutch navigators led by Abel TASMAN were the first
Europeans to land in Australia in 1606, and they mapped the western
and northern coasts. They named the continent New Holland but made
no attempts to permanently settle it. In 1770, English captain
James COOK sailed to the east coast of Australia, named it New
South Wales, and claimed it for Great Britain. In 1788 and 1825,
Great Britain established New South Wales and then Tasmania as
penal colonies respectively. Great Britain and Ireland sent more
than 150,000 convicts to Australia before ending the practice in
1868. As Europeans began settling areas away from the coasts, they
came into more direct contact with Aboriginal Australians.
Europeans also cleared land for agriculture, impacting Aboriginal
Australians’ ways of life. These issues, along with disease and a
policy in the 1900s that forcefully removed Aboriginal children
from their parents, reduced the Aboriginal Australian population
from more than 700,000 pre-European contact to a low of 74,000 in
1933.

Four additional colonies were established in Australia in the
mid-1800s: Western Australia (1829), South Australia (1836),
Victoria (1851), and Queensland (1859). Gold rushes beginning in
the 1850s brought thousands of new immigrants to New South Wales
and Victoria, helping to reorient Australia away from its penal
colony roots. In the second half of the 1800s, the colonies were
all gradually granted self-government, and in 1901, they federated
and became the Commonwealth of Australia. Australia contributed
more than 400,000 troops to Allied efforts during World War I, and
Australian troops played a large role in the defeat of Japanese
troops in the Pacific in World War II. Australia severed most
constitutional links with the UK in 1942, and in 1951 signed the
Australia, New Zealand, and US (ANZUS) Treaty, cementing its
military alliance with the United States.  In 2021, Australia,
the UK, and the US announced the AUKUS enhanced trilateral security
partnership to maintain and expand the three countries’ edge in
military capabilities and critical technologies. Australia’s
post-war economy boomed and by the 1970s, racial policies that
prevented most non-Whites from immigrating to Australia were
removed, greatly increasing Asian immigration to the country. In
recent decades, Australia has become an internationally
competitive, advanced market economy due in large part to economic
reforms adopted in the 1980s and its proximity to East and
Southeast Asia. In the early 2000s, Australian politics became unstable with
frequent attempts to oust party leaders, including five changes of
prime minister between 2010 and 2018. As a result, both major
parties instituted rules to make it harder to remove a party
leader.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">the Australian telecom market since 2020 has been impacted by the pandemic, which forced many people to school and work from home and thus adopt fixed-line broadband services; internet traffic, both fixed and mobile, increased substantially as a result; in the fixed sector, there is an ongoing migration from copper-based platforms to fiber; the extension of fixed wireless access will mean that up to 120,000 premises currently dependent on satellite broadband will be able to access 5G-based fixed services; the fixed-line market has been falling steadily over the past five years; in the Australian fixed broadband market, there is a dynamic shift among customers to fiber networks; the DSL sector is steadily shrinking while subscribers on HFC infrastructure will continue to be provided by existing cable, with a steady migration to full fiber connectivity (2022)</note>

      <subsection title="Military - note">Australia has been part of the Australia, New Zealand, and US
Security (ANZUS) Treaty since 1951; Australia is also a member of
the Five Powers Defense Arrangements (FPDA), a series of mutual
assistance agreements reached in 1971 embracing Australia,
Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and the UK; the FPDA commits the
members to consult with one another in the event or threat of an
armed attack on any of the members and to mutually decide what
measures should be taken, jointly or separately; there is no
specific obligation to intervene militarily 

Australia has a long-standing military relationship with the US;
Australian and US forces first fought together in France in 1918 at
the Battle of Hamel, and have fought together in every major US
conflict since; Australia and the US signed an agreement in 2014
that allowed for closer bi-lateral defense and security
cooperation, including annual rotations of US Marines and enhanced
rotations of US Air Force aircraft to Australia; Australian
military forces train often with US forces; Australia has Major
Non-NATO Ally (MNNA) status with the US, a designation under US law
that provides foreign partners with certain benefits in the areas
of defense trade and security cooperation 

Australia also has long-standing defense and security ties to the
UK, including a Defense and Security Cooperation Treaty signed in
2013; in 2020, Australia and the UK signed a memorandum of
understanding to cooperate on the building of a next generation of
frigates for their respective navies; the Australia-UK Ministerial
Consultations (AUKMIN) is their premier bilateral forum on foreign
policy, defense, and security issues 

in 2021, Australia, the UK, and the US announced an enhanced
trilateral security partnership called “AUKUS” which would build on
existing bilateral ties, including deeper integration of defense
and security-related science, technology, industrial bases, and
supply chains, as well as deeper cooperation on a range of defense
and security capabilities; the first initiative under AUKUS was a
commitment to support Australia in acquiring conventionally armed
nuclear-powered submarines for the Royal Australian Navy (2022)</subsection>
