   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Two centuries of Viking raids into Europe tapered off following
the adoption of Christianity by King Olav TRYGGVASON in 994;
conversion of the Norwegian kingdom occurred over the next several
decades. In 1397, Norway was absorbed into a union with Denmark
that lasted more than four centuries. In 1814, Norwegians resisted
the cession of their country to Sweden and adopted a new
constitution. Sweden then invaded Norway but agreed to let Norway
keep its constitution in return for accepting the union under a
Swedish king. Rising nationalism throughout the 19th century led to
a 1905 referendum granting Norway independence. Although Norway
remained neutral in World War I, it suffered heavy losses to its
shipping. Norway proclaimed its neutrality at the outset of World
War II but was nonetheless occupied for five years by Nazi Germany
(1940-45). In 1949, Norway abandoned neutrality and became a member
of NATO. Discovery of oil and gas in adjacent waters in the late
1960s boosted Norway's economic fortunes. In referenda held in 1972
and 1994, Norway rejected joining the EU. Key domestic issues
include immigration and integration of ethnic minorities,
maintaining the country's extensive social safety net with an aging
population, and preserving economic competitiveness.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">Norway has a sophisticated telecom market with high broadband and mobile penetration rates and a highly developed digital media sector; although not a member of the European Union, the country’s telecoms sector is synchronized with relevant EC legislation; the mobile broadband sector was bolstered by the auction of spectrum in the 700MHz and 21MHz band in June 2019; additional spectrum in the 700MHz is expected to be auctioned for mobile broadband use (5G) in 2021; the broadband penetration rate is among the highest in Europe, while in recent years subscribers have been migrated to faster broadband solutions over fiber networks, VDSL and upgraded cable infrastructure; in late 2019 the government proposed making broadband of at least 20Mb/s a universal service (2021)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>
