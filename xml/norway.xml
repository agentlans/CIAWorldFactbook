   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Two centuries of Viking raids into Europe tapered off following
the adoption of Christianity by King Olav TRYGGVASON in 994;
conversion of the Norwegian kingdom occurred over the next several
decades. In 1397, Norway was absorbed into a union with Denmark
that lasted more than four centuries. In 1814, Norwegians resisted
the cession of their country to Sweden and adopted a new
constitution. Sweden then invaded Norway but agreed to let Norway
keep its constitution in return for accepting the union under a
Swedish king. Rising nationalism throughout the 19th century led to
a 1905 referendum granting Norway independence. Although Norway
remained neutral in World War I, it suffered heavy losses to its
shipping. Norway proclaimed its neutrality at the outset of World
War II but was nonetheless occupied for five years by Nazi Germany
(1940-45). In 1949, Norway abandoned neutrality and became a member
of NATO. Discovery of oil and gas in adjacent waters in the late
1960s boosted Norway's economic fortunes. In referenda held in 1972
and 1994, Norway rejected joining the EU. Key domestic issues
include immigration and integration of ethnic minorities,
maintaining the country's extensive social safety net with an aging
population, and preserving economic competitiveness.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Norway has a sophisticated
telecom market with high broadband and mobile penetration rates and
a highly developed digital media sector; although not a member of
the European Union, the country’s telecoms sector is synchronized
with relevant EC legislation; the mobile broadband sector was
bolstered by the auction of spectrum in the 700MHz and 21MHz band
in June 2019; additional spectrum in the 700MHz is expected to be
auctioned for mobile broadband use (5G) in 2021; the broadband
penetration rate is among the highest in Europe, while in recent
years subscribers have been migrated to faster broadband solutions
over fiber networks, VDSL and upgraded cable infrastructure; in
late 2019 the government proposed making broadband of at least
20Mb/s a universal service (2021)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: Norway has a domestic satellite system;
the prevalence of rural areas encourages the wide use of
mobile-cellular systems; fixed-line over 6 per 100 and
mobile-cellular nearly 108 per 100 (2020)<br/>

station with the other Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland,

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
