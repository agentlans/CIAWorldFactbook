   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Bosnia and Herzegovina declared sovereignty in October 1991 and
independence from the former Yugoslavia on 3 March 1992 after a
referendum boycotted by ethnic Serbs. The Bosnian Serbs - supported
by neighboring Serbia and Montenegro - responded with armed
resistance aimed at partitioning the republic along ethnic lines
and joining Serb-held areas to form a "Greater Serbia." In March
1994, Bosniaks and Croats reduced the number of warring factions
from three to two by signing an agreement creating a joint
Bosniak-Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 21 November
1995, in Dayton, Ohio, the warring parties initialed a peace
agreement that ended three years of interethnic civil strife (the
final agreement was signed in Paris on 14 December 1995).The Dayton Peace Accords retained Bosnia and Herzegovina's
international boundaries and created a multiethnic and democratic
government charged with conducting foreign, diplomatic, and fiscal
policy. Also recognized was a second tier of government composed of
two entities roughly equal in size: the predominantly
Bosniak-Bosnian Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the
predominantly Bosnian Serb-led Republika Srpska (RS). The
Federation and RS governments are responsible for overseeing most
government functions. Additionally, the Dayton Accords established
the Office of the High Representative to oversee the implementation
of the civilian aspects of the agreement. The Peace Implementation
Council at its conference in Bonn in 1997 also gave the High
Representative the authority to impose legislation and remove
officials, the so-called "Bonn Powers." An original NATO-led
international peacekeeping force (IFOR) of 60,000 troops assembled
in 1995 was succeeded over time by a smaller, NATO-led
Stabilization Force (SFOR). In 2004, European Union peacekeeping
troops (EUFOR) replaced SFOR. Currently, EUFOR deploys around 600
troops in theater in a security assistance and training
capacity.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">the telecom market has been liberalized and a regulatory framework created based on the EU‚Äôs regulatory framework for communications; although Bosnia-Herzegovina remains an EU candidate country, in July 2017 it applied amended mobile roaming charges to fit in with changes introduced across the Union; further roaming agreements were made in 2019 with other western Balkan countries; the fixed-line broadband network is comparatively underdeveloped, with the result that investments made in mobile upgrades to facilitate broadband connectivity in the country to a greater extent than is common elsewhere in Europe; internet services are available; DSL and cable are the main platforms for fixed-line connectivity, while fiber broadband as yet has only a small market presence; the three MNOs, each affiliated with one of the incumbent fixed-line operators, provide national coverage with 3G, though LTE coverage is only about 89%; their upgraded networks are helping to support broadband in rural areas where fixed-line infrastructure is insufficient; mobile data and mobile broadband offers will provide future revenue growth given the limited potential of mobile voice services; the MNOs tested LTE services under trial licenses from 2013, commercial launches were delayed until the award of spectrum in early 2019; the regulator stipulated that licenses must provide national coverage within five years; trials of 5G technology have been undertaken, though there are no plans to launch services commercially in the short term, given that the MNOs can continue to exploit the capacity of their existing LTE networks (2021)</note>
