   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The peoples of Mongolia have a long history under a number of
nomadic empires dating back to the period of the Xiongnu in the 4th
century B.C. The name Mongol goes back to at least the 11th century
A.D. The most famous Mongol, TEMÜÜJIN (aka Genghis Khan) emerged as
the ruler of all Mongols in the early 1200s. By the time of his
death in 1227, he had created through conquest a Mongol Empire that
extended across much of Eurasia. His descendants, including ÖGÖDEI
and KHUBILAI (aka Kublai Khan), continued military campaigns of
conquest, taking control of Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and
the rest of China where KHUBILAI established the Yuan Dynasty in
the 1270s. The Mongols attempted to invade Japan and Java before
their empire broke apart in the 14th century. In the 17th century,
Mongolia fell under the rule of the Manchus of the Chinese Qing
Dynasty. Following the collapse of the Manchus in 1911, Mongolia
declared its independence, achieving it with help from the Soviet
Union in 1921. Mongolia became a socialist state (the Mongolian
People’s Republic) in 1924. Following independence and until the
collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, the country was a Soviet
satellite state, and heavily reliant on economic, military, and
political assistance from Moscow. The period also was marked by
purges, political repression, economic stagnation, and tensions
with China.<br/>
         <br/>
Mongolia peacefully transitioned to an independent democracy in
1990. In 1992, it adopted a new constitution and established a free
market economy. Since the country's transition, it has conducted
eight presidential and nine legislative elections as of 2021.
Throughout the period, the ex-communist Mongolian People's
Revolutionary Party (MPRP) - which took the name Mongolian People’s
Party (MPP) in 2010 - has competed for political power with the
Democratic Party (DP) and several other smaller parties. In the
2016 parliamentary elections, the MPP won overwhelming control of
the Parliament over the DP, which had overseen a sharp decline in
Mongolia’s economy during its control of the Parliament in the
preceding years. Mongolians elected a DP member, Khaltmaa BATTULGA,
as president in 2017. The June 2020 parliamentary elections left
the MPP with continued dominant control of the parliament.
Mongolians elected former prime minister and MPP member Ukhnaa
KHURELSUKH as president in 2021. Mongolia maintains close cultural,
political, and military ties with Russia while China is its largest
economic partner. Mongolia’s foreign relations are focused on
preserving its autonomy by balancing relations with China and
Russia, as well as its other major partners, Japan, South Korea,
and the US.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: liberalized and competitive
telecoms market comprises of a number of operators; fixed-line
penetration increased steadily in the years to 2018 as more people
took on fixed-line access for voice calls and to access
copper-based broadband services; the number of lines fell in 2019,
and again and more sharply in 2020, partly through the economic
consequences of the pandemic (GDP fell 5.3% in 2020, year-on-year)
and partly due to the migration to the mobile platform and to VoIP;
fixed broadband penetration remains low, mainly due to a limited
number of fixed lines and the dominance of the mobile platform; the
attraction of fixed broadband as a preferred access where it is
available is waning as the mobile networks are upgraded with
greater capacity and capabilities; the growing popularity of mobile
broadband continues to underpin overall broadband and telecom
sector growth, with Mongolia’s market very much being dominated by
mobile services, supported by widely available LTE; this will
largely determine and shape the future direction of Mongolia’s
developing digital economy (2021)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: very low fixed-line teledensity of less
than 5 per 100; there are four mobile-cellular providers and
subscribership is roughly 133 per 100 persons (2020)<br/>

international: country code - 976; satellite earth
stations - 7 (2016)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
