   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The peoples of Mongolia have a long history under a number of
nomadic empires dating back to the period of the Xiongnu in the 4th
century B.C. The name Mongol goes back to at least the 11th century
A.D. The most famous Mongol, TEMÜÜJIN (aka Genghis Khan) emerged as
the ruler of all Mongols in the early 1200s. By the time of his
death in 1227, he had created through conquest a Mongol Empire that
extended across much of Eurasia. His descendants, including ÖGÖDEI
and KHUBILAI (aka Kublai Khan), continued military campaigns of
conquest, taking control of Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and
the rest of China where KHUBILAI established the Yuan Dynasty in
the 1270s. The Mongols attempted to invade Japan and Java before
their empire broke apart in the 14th century. In the 17th century,
Mongolia fell under the rule of the Manchus of the Chinese Qing
Dynasty. Following the collapse of the Manchus in 1911, Mongolia
declared its independence, achieving it with help from the Soviet
Union in 1921. Mongolia became a socialist state (the Mongolian
People’s Republic) in 1924. Following independence and until the
collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, the country was a Soviet
satellite state, and heavily reliant on economic, military, and
political assistance from Moscow. The period also was marked by
purges, political repression, economic stagnation, and tensions
with China.

Mongolia peacefully transitioned to an independent democracy in
1990. In 1992, it adopted a new constitution and established a free
market economy. Since the country's transition, it has conducted
eight presidential and nine legislative elections as of 2021.
Throughout the period, the ex-communist Mongolian People's
Revolutionary Party (MPRP) - which took the name Mongolian People’s
Party (MPP) in 2010 - has competed for political power with the
Democratic Party (DP) and several other smaller parties. In the
2016 parliamentary elections, the MPP won overwhelming control of
the Parliament over the DP, which had overseen a sharp decline in
Mongolia’s economy during its control of the Parliament in the
preceding years. Mongolians elected a DP member, Khaltmaa BATTULGA,
as president in 2017. The June 2020 parliamentary elections left
the MPP with continued dominant control of the parliament.
Mongolians elected former prime minister and MPP member Ukhnaa
KHURELSUKH as president in 2021. Mongolia maintains close cultural,
political, and military ties with Russia while China is its largest
economic partner. Mongolia’s foreign relations are focused on
preserving its autonomy by balancing relations with China and
Russia, as well as its other major partners, Japan, South Korea,
and the US.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">liberalized and competitive telecoms market comprises of a number of operators; fixed-line penetration increased steadily in the years to 2018 as more people took on fixed-line access for voice calls and to access copper-based broadband services; the number of lines fell in 2019, and again and more sharply in 2020, partly through the economic consequences of the pandemic (GDP fell 5.3% in 2020, year-on-year) and partly due to the migration to the mobile platform and to VoIP; fixed broadband penetration remains low, mainly due to a limited number of fixed lines and the dominance of the mobile platform; the attraction of fixed broadband as a preferred access where it is available is waning as the mobile networks are upgraded with greater capacity and capabilities; the growing popularity of mobile broadband continues to underpin overall broadband and telecom sector growth, with Mongolia’s market very much being dominated by mobile services, supported by widely available LTE; this will largely determine and shape the future direction of Mongolia’s developing digital economy (2021)</note>
