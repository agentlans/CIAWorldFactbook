   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Vanuatu was first settled around 2000 B.C. by Austronesian
speakers from Solomon Islands. By around 1000, localized chieftain
systems began to develop on the islands. In the mid-1400s, the
Kuwae Volcano erupted, causing frequent conflict and internal
strife amid declining food availability, especially on Efate
Island. Around 1600, Chief ROI MATA united Efate under his rule. In
1606, Portuguese explorer Pedro Fernandes de QUEIROS was the first
European to see the Banks Islands and Espiritu Santo, setting up a
short-lived settlement on the latter. The next European explorers
arrived in the 1760s, and in 1774, British navigator James COOK
named the islands the New Hebrides. The islands were frequented by
whalers in the 1800s and interest in harvesting the islands’
sandalwood trees caused conflict between Europeans and local
Ni-Vanuatu. Catholic and Protestant missionaries arrived in the
1840s but faced difficulties converting the locals. In the 1860s,
European planters in Australia, Fiji, New Caledonia, and Samoa
needed labor and kidnapped almost half the adult males of the
islands and forced them to work as indentured servants.<br/>
         <br/>
With growing and overlapping interests in the islands, France and
the UK agreed that the New Hebrides would be neutral in 1878 and
established a joint naval commission in 1887. In 1906, the two
countries created the British-French Condominium to jointly
administer the islands and they established separate laws, police
forces, currencies, and education and health systems. The
condominium arrangement was dysfunctional and the UK used France’s
defeat to Germany in World War II to assert greater control over
the islands. As Japan pushed into Melanesia, the US stationed up to
50,000 soldiers in Vanuatu to prevent further advances. In 1945, US
troops withdrew and sold their equipment, leading to the rise of
political and religious cargo cults, such as the John Frum
movement.<br/>
         <br/>
The France-UK condominium was reestablished after World War II. The
UK was interested in moving the condominium toward independence in
the 1960s, but France was hesitant and political parties agitating
independence began to form, largely divided along linguistic lines.
France eventually relented and elections were held in 1974 with
independence granted in 1980 as Vanuatu under English-speaking
Prime Minister Walter LINI. At independence, the Nagriamel
Movement, with support from French-speaking landowners, declared
Espiritu Santo independent, but the short-lived state was dissolved
12 weeks later. Linguistic divisions have lessened over time but
highly fractious political parties have led to weak coalition
governments that require support from both Anglophone and
Francophone parties. Since 2008, prime ministers have been ousted
through no-confidence motions or temporary procedural issues 10
times.<br/>

isosceles triangle (based on the hoist side) all separated by a
black-edged yellow stripe in the shape of a horizontal Y (the two
points of the Y face the hoist side and enclose the triangle);
centered in the triangle is a boar's tusk encircling two crossed
namele fern fronds, all in yellow; red represents the blood of
boars and men, as well as unity, green the richness of the islands,
and black the ni-Vanuatu people; the yellow Y-shape - which
reflects the pattern of the islands in the Pacific Ocean -
symbolizes the light of the Gospel spreading through the islands;
the boar's tusk is a symbol of prosperity frequently worn as a
pendant on the islands; the fern fronds represent peace<br/>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: for many years, 2G Global
System for Mobile Communications was the primary mobile technology
for Vanuatu’s 300,000 people; recent infrastructure projects have
improved access technologies, with a transition to 3G and, to a
limited degree, to LTE; Vanuatu has also benefited from the ICN1
submarine cable and the launch of the Kacific-1 satellite, both of
which have considerably improved access to telecom services in
recent years; Vanuatu’s telecom sector is liberalized, with the two
prominent mobile operators; while fixed broadband penetration
remains low, the incumbent operator is slowly exchanging copper
fixed-lines for fiber; a number of ongoing submarine cable
developments will also assist in increasing data rates and reduce
internet pricing in coming years (2021)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line teledensity a bit over 1 per
100 and mobile-cellular just over 80 per 100 (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 678; landing points
for the ICN1 &amp; ICN2 submarine cables providing connectivity to
the Solomon Islands and Fiji; cables helped end-users with Internet
bandwidth; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Pacific Ocean)
(2020)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
