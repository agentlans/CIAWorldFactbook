   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Paracel Islands are surrounded by productive fishing grounds
and by potential oil and gas reserves. In 1932, French Indochina
annexed the islands and set up a weather station on Pattle Island;
maintenance was continued by its successor, Vietnam. China has
occupied all the Paracel Islands since 1974, when its troops seized
a South Vietnamese garrison occupying the western islands. China
built a military installation on Woody Island with an airfield and
artificial harbor, and has scattered garrisons on some of the other
islands. The Paracel islands also are claimed by Taiwan and
Vietnam.</subsection>
