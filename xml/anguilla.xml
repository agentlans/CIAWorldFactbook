   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Colonized by English settlers from Saint Kitts in 1650, Anguilla
was administered by Great Britain until the early 19th century,
when the island - against the wishes of the inhabitants - was
incorporated into a single British dependency along with Saint
Kitts and Nevis. Several attempts at separation failed. In 1971,
two years after a revolt, Anguilla was finally allowed to secede;
this arrangement was formally recognized in 1980, with Anguilla
becoming a separate British dependency. On 7 September 2017, the
island suffered extensive damage from Hurricane Irma, particularly
to communications and residential and business infrastructure.</subsection>
