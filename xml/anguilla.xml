   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Colonized by English settlers from Saint Kitts in 1650, Anguilla
was administered by Great Britain until the early 19th century,
when the island - against the wishes of the inhabitants - was
incorporated into a single British dependency along with Saint
Kitts and Nevis. Several attempts at separation failed. In 1971,
two years after a revolt, Anguilla was finally allowed to secede;
this arrangement was formally recognized in 1980, with Anguilla
becoming a separate British dependency. On 7 September 2017, the
island suffered extensive damage from Hurricane Irma, particularly
to communications and residential and business infrastructure.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: in the telecom sector, with
declines seen in subscriber numbers (particularly for prepaid
mobile services — the mainstay of short-term visitors) and revenue;
fixed and mobile broadband services are two areas that have
benefited from the crisis to a small extent as employees and
students have resorted to working from home, but their contribution
to the sector has been insufficient to offset steep falls in other
areas of the market; one area of the telecom market that does not
yet appear poised for growth is 5G mobile; governments, regulators,
and even the mobile network operators have shown that they have
little appetite for investing in 5G opportunities at the present
time; network expansion and enhancements remain concentrated around
improving LTE coverage; until the economies and markets stabilize,
and overseas visitors return there is unlikely to be much momentum
towards implementing 5G capabilities anywhere in the region

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
