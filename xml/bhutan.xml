   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Following Britainâ€™s victory in the 1865 Duar War, Britain and
Bhutan signed the Treaty of Sinchulu, under which Bhutan would
receive an annual subsidy in exchange for ceding land to British
India. Ugyen WANGCHUCK - who had served as the de facto ruler of an
increasingly unified Bhutan and had improved relations with the
British toward the end of the 19th century - was named king in
1907. Three years later, a treaty was signed whereby the British
agreed not to interfere in Bhutanese internal affairs, and Bhutan
allowed Britain to direct its foreign affairs. Bhutan negotiated a
similar arrangement with independent India in 1949. The
Indo-Bhutanese Treaty of Friendship returned to Bhutan a small
piece of the territory annexed by the British, formalized the
annual subsidies the country received, and defined India's
responsibilities in defense and foreign relations. Under a
succession of modernizing monarchs beginning in the 1950s, Bhutan
joined the UN in 1971 and slowly continued its engagement beyond
its borders.In 2005, King Jigme Singye WANGCHUCK unveiled the draft of
Bhutan's first constitution - which introduced major democratic
reforms - and held a national referendum for its approval. The King
abdicated the throne in 2006 in favor of his son, Jigme Khesar
Namgyel WANGCHUCK. In 2007, India and Bhutan renegotiated their
treaty, eliminating the clause that stated that Bhutan would be
"guided by" India in conducting its foreign policy, although
Thimphu continues to coordinate closely with New Delhi. In 2008,
Bhutan held its first parliamentary election in accordance with the
constitution. Bhutan experienced a peaceful turnover of power
following a parliamentary election in 2013, which resulted in the
defeat of the incumbent party. In 2018, the incumbent party again
lost the parliamentary election. Of the more than 100,000 ethnic
Nepali - predominantly Lhotshampa - refugees who fled or were
forced out of Bhutan in the 1990s, about 6,500 remain displaced in
Nepal.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">the small land-locked Kingdom of Bhutan has only recently emerged from decades of isolation from the modern world; that, and its mountainous terrain, left the country far back in the field in terms of teledensity as well as access to the Internet; over the last decade, the country has undergone a significant transformation due to the opening of its borders, liberalization of its telecom sector, and the active support from the government towards increased competition in the mobile, broadband, and ISP segments; the relatively widespread availability of the mobile platform has caused an explosion in mobile broadband subscriber numbers, growing from zero to over 100% penetration in just ten years (between 2010 and 2019).; the onset of the Covid-19 crisis in 2020 caused the subscription rates to drop back a little; growth is projected to return in 2022 (along with the broader mobile market) as the overall economy recovers; the government opens up more to foreign investment, trade, and tourism; and network expansion continues â€“ the recent (December 2021) launch of 5G services by both of the countryâ€™s mobile operators being particularly noteworthy (2022)</note>

         <note title="tier rating"/>Tier 2 Watch List â€” Bhutan does not fully meet the minimum
standards for the elimination of trafficking but is making efforts
to do so; the government increased convictions of traffickers and
the number of victims identified and referred to services;
officials drafted and launched an anti-trafficking National Action
Plan; however, the government did not demonstrate overall
increasing anti-trafficking efforts compared with the previous
year; the government reported only one investigation and did not
initiate any new prosecutions, and the overall identification
efforts remained insufficient; because the government has devoted
sufficient resources to a written plan that, if implemented, would
constitute significant efforts to meet the minimum standards,
Bhutan was granted a waiver per the TVPA from a downgrade to Tier
3; therefore Bhutan remained on Tier 2 Watch List for the third
consecutive year (2022)<note title="trafficking profile"/>Trafficking profile:Â  human traffickers exploit domestic
and foreign victims in Bhutan and exploit victims from Bhutan
abroad; unregistered foreign employment recruitment agencies
increasingly operate through social media to target unemployed or
economically disadvantaged individuals; Bhutanese citizens working
in hospitality, retail, and services sectors in the Gulf, including
in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and the UAE, and in India, Thailand, and
the United Kingdom, reported indicators of trafficking; in recent
years traffickers sent Bhutanese women to Iraq and Oman for forced
labor in domestic work; traffickers have exploited Bhutanese women
and girls in sex and labor trafficking, including in forced
domestic labor and caregiving; reports indicate an increase in
commercial sex by Bhutanese and Indian women in the Bhutan-India
borderâ€™s growing hospitality and entertainment districtsâ€”including
hotels, massage parlors, and nightclubsâ€”some of which might be
forced; traffickers reportedly have exploited Indian child domestic
workers and male Indian migrants working in the construction and
hydropower sectors; rural Bhutanese transported to urban areas may
be involved in forced domestic work, and child labor in restaurants
and automotive workshops may involve forced labor (2022)</subsection>
