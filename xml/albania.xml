   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Albania declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire in
1912, but was conquered by Italy in 1939 and occupied by Germany in
1943. Communist partisans took over the country in 1944. Albania
allied itself first with the USSR (until 1960), and then with China
(to 1978). In the early 1990s, Albania ended 46 years
of isolated communist rule and established a multiparty
democracy. The transition has proven challenging as successive
governments have tried to deal with high unemployment, widespread
corruption, dilapidated infrastructure, powerful organized crime
networks, and combative political opponents.Albania has made progress in its democratic development since it
first held multiparty elections in 1991, but deficiencies
remain. Most of Albania's post-communist elections were marred by
claims of electoral fraud; however, international observers judged
elections to be largely free and fair since the restoration of
political stability following the collapse of pyramid schemes in
1997. Albania joined NATO in April 2009 and in June 2014 became an
EU candidate. Albania in April 2017 received a European
Commission recommendation to open EU accession negotiations
following the passage of historic EU-mandated justice reforms in
2016. Although Albania's economy continues to grow, it has slowed,
and the country is still one of the poorest in Europe. A large
informal economy and a weak energy and transportation
infrastructure remain obstacles.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">Albania’s small telecom market has experienced some significant changes in recent years;  upgrades were made to the fixed-line infrastructure to support broadband services; fixed-line telephony use and penetration in Albania is declining steadily as subscribers migrate to mobile solutions; the mobile sector is well provided with LTE networks, while operators have invested in 5G; some of these efforts have been made in conjunction with neighboring Kosovo, with the intention of a seamless 5G corridor along the highway connecting the two countries; the country has long sought accession to the European Union (EU) which has benefited its telecoms sector through closer scrutiny of its regulatory regime and through the injection of funding to help modernize infrastructure (2021)</note>
         <note title="domestic">fixed-line approximately 7 per 100, teledensity continues to decline due to heavy use of mobile-cellular telephone services; mobile-cellular telephone use is widespread and generally effective, 92 per 100 for mobile-cellular (2021)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>
