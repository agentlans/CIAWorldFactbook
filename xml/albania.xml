   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Albania declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire in
1912, but was conquered by Italy in 1939 and occupied by Germany in
1943. Communist partisans took over the country in 1944. Albania
allied itself first with the USSR (until 1960), and then with China
(to 1978). In the early 1990s, Albania ended 46 years
of isolated communist rule and established a multiparty
democracy. The transition has proven challenging as successive
governments have tried to deal with high unemployment, widespread
corruption, dilapidated infrastructure, powerful organized crime
networks, and combative political opponents.Albania has made progress in its democratic development since it
first held multiparty elections in 1991, but deficiencies
remain. Most of Albania's post-communist elections were marred by
claims of electoral fraud; however, international observers judged
elections to be largely free and fair since the restoration of
political stability following the collapse of pyramid schemes in
1997. Albania joined NATO in April 2009 and in June 2014 became an
EU candidate. Albania in April 2017 received a European
Commission recommendation to open EU accession negotiations
following the passage of historic EU-mandated justice reforms in
2016. Although Albania's economy continues to grow, it has slowed,
and the country is still one of the poorest in Europe. A large
informal economy and a weak energy and transportation
infrastructure remain obstacles.</subsection>

regions (1443-78); an unsubstantiated explanation for the eagle

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Albania’s small telecom
market has experienced some significant changes in recent
years;  upgrades were made to the fixed-line infrastructure to
support broadband services; fixed-line telephony use and
penetration in Albania is declining steadily as subscribers migrate
to mobile solutions; the mobile sector is well provided with LTE
networks, while operators have invested in 5G; some of these
efforts have been made in conjunction with neighboring Kosovo, with
the intention of a seamless 5G corridor along the highway
connecting the two countries; the country has long sought accession
to the European Union (EU) which has benefited its telecoms sector
through closer scrutiny of its regulatory regime and through the
injection of funding to help modernize infrastructure (2021)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line approximately 7 per 100,
teledensity continues to decline due to heavy use of
mobile-cellular telephone services; mobile-cellular telephone use
is widespread and generally effective, 92 per 100 for
mobile-cellular (2021)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 355; submarine
cables for the Adria 1 and Italy-Albania provide connectivity
to Italy, Croatia, and Greece; a combination submarine cable and
land fiber-optic system, provides additional connectivity to
Bulgaria, Macedonia, and Turkey; international traffic carried by
fiber-optic cable and, when necessary, by microwave radio relay
from the Tirana exchange to Italy and Greece (2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
      <subsection title="Broadcast media">Albania has more than 65 TV stations, including several that
broadcast nationally; Albanian TV broadcasts are also available to
Albanian-speaking populations in neighboring countries; many
viewers have access to Italian and Greek TV broadcasts via
terrestrial reception; Albania's TV stations have begun a
government-mandated conversion from analog to digital broadcast;
the government has pledged to provide analog-to-digital converters
to low-income families affected by this decision; cable TV service
is available; 2 public radio networks and roughly 78 private radio
stations; several international broadcasters are available
