   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Following its heyday as a global maritime power during the 15th
and 16th centuries, Portugal lost much of its wealth and status
with the destruction of Lisbon in a 1755 earthquake, occupation
during the Napoleonic Wars, and the independence of Brazil, its
wealthiest colony, in 1822. A 1910 revolution deposed the monarchy,
and for most of the next six decades, repressive governments ran
the country. In 1974, a left-wing military coup installed broad
democratic reforms. The following year, Portugal granted
independence to all of its African colonies. Portugal is a founding
member of NATO and entered the EC (now the EU) in 1986.</subsection>

etymology: Lisbon is one of Europe's oldest cities
(the second oldest capital city after Athens) and the origin of the
name is lost in time; it may have been founded as an ancient Celtic
settlement that subsequently maintained close commercial relations
with the Phoenicians (beginning about 1200 B.C.); the name of the
settlement may have been derived from the pre-Roman appellation for
the Tagus River that runs through the city, Lisso or Lucio; the
Romans named the city "Olisippo" when they took it from the
Carthaginians in 205 B.C.; under the Visigoths the city name became
"Ulixbona," under the Arabs it was "al-Ushbuna"; the medieval
version of "Lissabona" became today's Lisboa</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Portugal has a medium-sized
telecom market with a strong mobile sector and a growing broadband
customer base; before the pandemic, the country had seen improving
economic growth, following several years of austerity measures;
revenue among some operators remains under pressure, though
investments in network upgrades are continuing in an effort to
attract customers to high-end services; Portugal’s broadband
services have grown steadily in recent years, largely the result of
joint efforts between the regulator and the key market operators
which have invested in significant infrastructure upgrades; these
operators are focused on fiber-based services, resulting in a
migration of subscribers from digital subscriber line DSL
infrastructure; the government has also supported open-access
wholesale networks; the mobile virtual network operator (MVNO)
market remains largely undeveloped, partly because network
operators have their own low-cost brands; collectively, MVNOs have
about 2.9% share of the market; population coverage by 3G
infrastructure is universal, and most investment in the sector is
being directed to LTE and 5G technologies; the MNOs have trialed 5G
and are looking to launch commercial services (2021)<br/>

America and the US; satellite earth stations - 3 Intelsat (2
Atlantic Ocean and 1 Indian Ocean), NA Eutelsat; tropospheric
scatter to Azores (2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
