   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Following its heyday as a global maritime power during the 15th
and 16th centuries, Portugal lost much of its wealth and status
with the destruction of Lisbon in a 1755 earthquake, occupation
during the Napoleonic Wars, and the independence of Brazil, its
wealthiest colony, in 1822. A 1910 revolution deposed the monarchy,
and for most of the next six decades, repressive governments ran
the country. In 1974, a left-wing military coup installed broad
democratic reforms. The following year, Portugal granted
independence to all of its African colonies. Portugal is a founding
member of NATO and entered the EC (now the EU) in 1986.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">Portugal has a medium-sized telecom market with a strong mobile sector and a growing broadband customer base; before the pandemic, the country had seen improving economic growth, following several years of austerity measures; revenue among some operators remains under pressure, though investments in network upgrades are continuing in an effort to attract customers to high-end services; Portugal’s broadband services have grown steadily in recent years, largely the result of joint efforts between the regulator and the key market operators which have invested in significant infrastructure upgrades; these operators are focused on fiber-based services, resulting in a migration of subscribers from digital subscriber line DSL infrastructure; the government has also supported open-access wholesale networks; the mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) market remains largely undeveloped, partly because network operators have their own low-cost brands; collectively, MVNOs have about 2.9% share of the market; population coverage by 3G infrastructure is universal, and most investment in the sector is being directed to LTE and 5G technologies; the MNOs have trialed 5G and are looking to launch commercial services (2021)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>
