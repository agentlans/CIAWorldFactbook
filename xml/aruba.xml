   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Discovered and claimed for Spain in 1499, Aruba was acquired by
the Dutch in 1636. The island's economy has been dominated by three
main industries. A 19th century gold rush was followed by
prosperity brought on by the opening in 1924 of an oil refinery.
The last decades of the 20th century saw a boom in the tourism
industry. Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles in 1986 and
became a separate, semi-autonomous member of the Kingdom of the
Netherlands. Movement toward full independence was halted at
Aruba's request in 1990.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">the telecom sector has seen a decline in subscriber numbers (particularly for prepaid mobile services the mainstay of short term visitors) and revenue; fixed and mobile broadband services are two areas that have benefited from the crisis as employees and students have resorted to working from home; one area of the telecom market that is not prepared for growth is 5G mobile; governments, regulators, and even the mobile network operators have shown that they have not been investing in 5G opportunities at the present time; network expansion and enhancements remain concentrated around improving LTE coverage (2021)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>
