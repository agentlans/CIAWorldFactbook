   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Popes in their secular role ruled portions of the Italian
peninsula for more than a thousand years until the mid-19th
century, when many of the Papal States were seized by the newly
united Kingdom of Italy. In 1870, the pope's holdings were further
circumscribed when Rome itself was annexed. Disputes between a
series of "prisoner" popes and Italy were resolved in 1929 by three
Lateran Treaties, which established the independent state of
Vatican City and granted Roman Catholicism special status in Italy.
In 1984, a concordat between the Holy See and Italy modified
certain of the earlier treaty provisions, including the primacy of
Roman Catholicism as the Italian state religion. Present concerns
of the Holy See include religious freedom, threats against minority
Christian communities in Africa and the Middle East, the plight of
refugees and migrants, sexual misconduct by clergy, international
development, interreligious dialogue and reconciliation, and the
application of church doctrine in an era of rapid change and
globalization. About 1.3 billion people worldwide profess
Catholicism - the world's largest Christian faith.</subsection>
