      <subsection title="Background">Although first sighted by an English navigator in 1592, the
first landing (English) did not occur until almost a century later
in 1690, and the first settlement (French) was not established
until 1764. The colony was turned over to Spain two years later and
the islands have since been the subject of a territorial dispute,
first between Britain and Spain, then between Britain and
Argentina. The UK asserted its claim to the islands by establishing
a naval garrison there in 1833. Argentina invaded the islands on 2
April 1982. The British responded with an expeditionary force that
landed seven weeks later and after fierce fighting forced an
Argentine surrender on 14 June 1982. With hostilities ended and
Argentine forces withdrawn, UK administration resumed. In response
to renewed calls from Argentina for Britain to relinquish control
of the islands, a referendum was held in March 2013, which resulted
in 99.8% of the population voting to remain a part of the UK.</subsection>

name applied to the islands by French explorer Louis-Antoine de

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: the replacement of the
rural internet and phone system was delayed due to COVID; upgrades
started at the end of 2019, this included the replacement of all
Multi Service Access Nodes (MSANs), the technology used to connect
larger settlements; in early 2020 a new system to replace the WiMAX
system (the technology used to connect smaller settlements and
households) had been delayed as well due to COVID-19; once the
equipment is received it will be installed in the largest base
stations on East Falklands: Malo, Bombilla, and Mt Pleasant
peak<br/>
         <br/>
         <br/>
“We also have MSAN equipment and radio links due to arrive towards
the end of this month, and these and will be installed at Chartres,
New Island, Sea Lion Island, Onion Range, Sand Bay, and Mare
Harbour enabling us to migrate additional customers from the
existing WiMAX network and also releasing equipment for spares.”
