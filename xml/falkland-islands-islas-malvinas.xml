   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Although first sighted by an English navigator in 1592, the
first landing (English) did not occur until almost a century later
in 1690, and the first settlement (French) was not established
until 1764. The colony was turned over to Spain two years later and
the islands have since been the subject of a territorial dispute,
first between Britain and Spain, then between Britain and
Argentina. The UK asserted its claim to the islands by establishing
a naval garrison there in 1833. Argentina invaded the islands on 2
April 1982. The British responded with an expeditionary force that
landed seven weeks later and after fierce fighting forced an
Argentine surrender on 14 June 1982. With hostilities ended and
Argentine forces withdrawn, UK administration resumed. In response
to renewed calls from Argentina for Britain to relinquish control
of the islands, a referendum was held in March 2013, which resulted
in 99.8% of the population voting to remain a part of the UK.</subsection>
