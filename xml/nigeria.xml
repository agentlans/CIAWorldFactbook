   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">In ancient and pre-colonial times, the area of present-day
Nigeria was occupied by a great diversity of ethnic groups with
different languages and traditions. These included Islamic empires
in northern Nigeria and smaller organized political groupings in
southern Nigeria. British influence and control over what would
become Nigeria and Africa's most populous country grew through the
19th century. In 1914, the British amalgamated their separately
administered northern and southern territories into modern-day
Nigeria. A series of constitutions after World War II granted
Nigeria greater autonomy. After independence in 1960, politics were
marked by coups and mostly military rule, until the death of a
military head of state in 1998 allowed for a political transition.
In 1999, a new constitution was adopted and a peaceful transition
to civilian government was completed. The government continues to
face the daunting task of institutionalizing democracy and
reforming a petroleum-based economy, whose revenues have been
squandered through decades of corruption and mismanagement. In
addition, Nigeria continues to experience longstanding ethnic and
religious tensions. Although both the 2003 and 2007 presidential
elections were marred by significant irregularities and violence,
Nigeria is currently experiencing its longest period of civilian
rule since independence. The general elections of 2007 marked the
first civilian-to-civilian transfer of power in the country's
history. National and state elections in 2011 and 2015 were
generally regarded as credible. The 2015 election was also heralded
for the fact that the then-umbrella opposition party, the All
Progressives Congress, defeated the long-ruling People's Democratic
Party that had governed since 1999, and assumed the presidency,
marking the first peaceful transfer of power from one party to
another. Presidential and legislative elections were held in early
2019 and deemed broadly free and fair despite voting
irregularities, intimidation, and violence.</subsection>

million people in 2016 to 392 million in 2050, becoming the world’s
fourth most populous country. Nigeria’s sustained high population
growth rate will continue for the foreseeable future because of
population momentum and its high birth rate. Abuja has not
successfully implemented family planning programs to reduce and
space births because of a lack of political will, government
financing, and the availability and affordability of services and
products, as well as a cultural preference for large families.
Increased educational attainment, especially among women, and
improvements in health care are needed to encourage and to better
enable parents to opt for smaller families.Nigeria needs to harness the potential of its burgeoning youth
population in order to boost economic development, reduce
widespread poverty, and channel large numbers of unemployed youth
into productive activities and away from ongoing religious and
ethnic violence. While most movement of Nigerians is internal,
significant emigration regionally and to the West provides an
outlet for Nigerians looking for economic opportunities, seeking
asylum, and increasingly pursuing higher education. Immigration
largely of West Africans continues to be insufficient to offset
emigration and the loss of highly skilled workers. Nigeria also is
a major source, transit, and destination country for forced labor
and sex trafficking.</subsection>

      </subsection>
      <subsection title="Military - note">as of 2022, the Nigerian military was sub-Saharan Africa’s
largest and regarded as one of its most capable forces; it was
focused largely on internal security and faced a number of
challenges that have stretched its resources, however; the Army was
deployed in all 36 of the country's states; in the northeast, it
was conducting counterinsurgency/counter-terrorist operations
against the Boko Haram (BH) and Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham
in West Africa (ISIS-WA) terrorist groups, where it has deployed as
many as 70,000 troops at times and jihadist-related violence has
killed an estimated 35-40,000 people, mostly civilians, since 2009
(as of 2022); in the northwest, it faced growing threats from
criminal gangs, bandits, and violence associated with historical
and ongoing farmer-herder conflicts, as well as BH and ISIS-WA
terrorists; bandits in the northwest were estimated to number in
the low 10,000s and violence there has killed more than 10,000
since the mid-2010s; the military also continued to protect the oil
industry in the Niger Delta region against militants and criminal
activity, although the levels of violence there have decreased in
recent years; beginning in May 2021, a contingent of military
troops and police were deployed to eastern Nigeria to quell renewed
agitation for a state of Biafra (Biafra seceded from Nigeria in the
late 1960s, sparking a civil war that caused more than 1 million
deaths)

as of 2022, the Navy was focused on security in the Gulf of Guinea;
since 2016, it has developed a maritime strategy, boosted naval
training and its naval presence in the Gulf, increased
participation in regional maritime security efforts, and acquired a
significant number of new naval platforms, including offshore and
coastal patrol craft, fast attack boats, and air assets

the Nigerian military traces its origins to the Nigeria Regiment of
the West African Frontier Force (WAFF), a multi-regiment force
formed by the British colonial office in 1900 to garrison the West
African colonies of Nigeria (Lagos and the protectorates of
Northern and Southern Nigeria), Gold Coast, Sierra Leone, and
Gambia; the WAFF served with distinction in both East and West
Africa during World War I; in 1928, it received royal recognition
and was re-named the Royal West African Frontier Force (RWAFF); the
RWAFF went on to serve in World War II as part of the British
81st and 82nd (West African) divisions in the
East Africa and Burma campaigns; in 1956, the Nigeria Regiment of
the RWAFF was renamed the Nigerian Military Forces (NMF) and in
1958, the colonial government of Nigeria took over control of the
NMF from the British War Office; the Nigerian Armed Forces were
established following independence in 1960</subsection>
      <subsection title="Maritime threats">the International Maritime Bureau reports the territorial and
offshore waters in the Niger Delta and Gulf of Guinea remain a very
high risk for piracy and armed robbery of ships; in 2021, there
were 34 reported incidents of piracy and armed robbery at sea in
the Gulf of Guinea region; although a significant decrease from the
total number of 81 incidents in 2020, it included the one hijacking
and three of five ships fired upon worldwide; while boarding and
attempted boarding to steal valuables from ships and crews are the
most common types of incidents, almost a third of all incidents
involve a hijacking and/or kidnapping; in 2021, 57 crew members
were kidnapped in seven separate incidents in the Gulf of Guinea,
representing 100% of kidnappings worldwide; Nigerian pirates in
particular are well armed and very aggressive, operating as far as
200 nm offshore; the Maritime Administration of the US Department
of Transportation has issued a Maritime Advisory (2022-001 - Gulf
of Guinea-Piracy/Armed Robbery/Kidnapping for Ransom) effective 4
January 2022, which states in part, "Piracy, armed robbery, and
kidnapping for ransom continue to serve as significant threats to
US-flagged vessels transiting or operating in the Gulf of
Guinea"</subsection>
