   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The United Kingdom has historically played a leading role in
developing parliamentary democracy and in advancing literature and
science. At its zenith in the 19th century, the British Empire
stretched over one-fourth of the earth's surface. The first half of
the 20th century saw two World Wars seriously deplete the UK's
strength and the Irish Republic withdraw from the union. The second
half witnessed the dismantling of the Empire and the UK rebuilding
itself into a modern and prosperous European nation. As one of five
permanent members of the UN Security Council and a founding member
of NATO and the Commonwealth of Nations, the UK pursues a global
approach to foreign policy. The Scottish Parliament, the National
Assembly for Wales, and the Northern Ireland Assembly were
established in 1998.The UK was an active member of the EU after its accession in
1973, although it chose to remain outside the Economic and Monetary
Union. However, motivated in part by frustration at a remote
bureaucracy in Brussels and massive migration into the country, UK
citizens on 23 June 2016 voted by 52 to 48 percent to leave the EU.
The UK became the first country to depart the EU on 31 January
2020, after prolonged negotiations on EU-UK economic and security
relationships had been hammered out.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Military - note">the UK is a member of NATO and was one of the original 12
countries to sign the North Atlantic Treaty (also known as the
Washington Treaty) in 1949; the UK is also a member of the Five
Powers Defense Arrangements (FPDA), a series of mutual assistance
agreements reached in 1971 embracing Australia, Malaysia, New
Zealand, Singapore, and the UK; the FPDA commits the members to
consult with one another in the event or threat of an armed attack
on any of the members and to mutually decide what measures should
be taken, jointly or separately; there is no specific obligation to
intervene militarily

in 2010, France and the UK signed a declaration on defense and
security cooperation that included greater military
interoperability and a Combined Joint Expeditionary Force (CJEF), a
deployable, combined Anglo-French military force for use in a wide
range of crisis scenarios, up to and including high intensity
combat operations; the CJEF has no standing forces but would be
available at short notice for UK-French bilateral, NATO, EU, UN, or
other operations; combined training exercises began in 2011; as of
2020, the CJEF was assessed as having full operating capacity with
the ability to rapidly deploy over 10,000 personnel capable of high
intensity operations, peacekeeping, disaster relief, and
humanitarian assistance

in 2014, the UK led the formation of the Joint Expeditionary Force
(JEF), a pool of high-readiness military forces from Baltic and
Scandinavian countries able to respond to a wide range of
contingencies both in peacetime and in times of crisis or conflict;
its principal geographic area of interest is the High North, North
Atlantic, and Baltic Sea regions, where the JEF can complement
national capabilities or NATO’s deterrence posture, although it is
designed to be flexible and prepared to respond to humanitarian
crises further afield; the JEF consists of 10 countries (Denmark,
Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands,
Norway, Sweden, and the UK) and was declared operational in 2018;
most of the forces in the pool are British, and the UK provides the
most rapidly deployable units as well as the command and control
elements

the British Armed Forces were formed in 1707 as the armed forces of
the Kingdom of Great Britain when England and Scotland merged under
the terms of the Treaty of Union; while the origins of the armed
forces of England and Scotland stretch back to the Middle Ages, the
first standing armies for England and Scotland were organized in
the 1600s while the navies were formed in the 1500s; the Royal
Marines were established in 1755; the Royal Air Force was created
in April 1918 by the merger of the British Army's Royal Flying
Corps and the Admiralty's Royal Naval Air Service (2022)</subsection>
