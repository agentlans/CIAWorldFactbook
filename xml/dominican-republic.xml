   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Taino - indigenous inhabitants of Hispaniola prior to the
arrival of Europeans - divided the island into five chiefdoms and
territories. Christopher COLUMBUS explored and claimed the island
on his first voyage in 1492; it became a springboard for Spanish
conquest of the Caribbean and the American mainland. In 1697, Spain
recognized French dominion over the western third of the island,
which in 1804 became Haiti. The remainder of the island, by then
known as Santo Domingo, sought to gain its own independence in 1821
but was conquered and ruled by the Haitians for 22 years; it
finally attained independence as the Dominican Republic in 1844. In
1861, the Dominicans voluntarily returned to the Spanish Empire,
but two years later they launched a war that restored independence
in 1865. A legacy of unsettled, mostly non-representative rule
followed, capped by the dictatorship of Rafael Leonidas TRUJILLO
from 1930 to 1961. Juan BOSCH was elected president in 1962 but was
deposed in a military coup in 1963. In 1965, the US led an
intervention in the midst of a civil war sparked by an uprising to
restore BOSCH. In 1966, Joaquin BALAGUER defeated BOSCH in the
presidential election. BALAGUER maintained a tight grip on power
for most of the next 30 years when international reaction to flawed
elections forced him to curtail his term in 1996. Since then,
regular competitive elections have been held in which opposition
candidates have won the presidency. Former President Leonel
FERNANDEZ Reyna (first term 1996-2000) won election to a new term
in 2004 following a constitutional amendment allowing presidents to
serve more than one term, and was later reelected to a second
consecutive term. Following the two-term presidency of Danilo
MEDINA Sanchez (2012-2020), Luis Rodolfo ABINADER Corona was
elected president in July 2020.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: the Dominican Republic’s
telecom sector continued its solid form throughout 2020 and into
2021, shrugging off the economic turmoil unleashed by the Covid-19
pandemic to maintain a decade-long run of low but positive growth
across all areas of the market; the Dominican Republic remains
behind most of its counterparts in the Latin American region,
especially in terms of fixed-line network coverage; mobile
subscriptions are on par with the regional average, but at
subscription levels of around 88% there is still ample opportunity
for growth; in terms of growth, the standout winner was once again
the mobile broadband segment; the market is expected to see close
to 8% growth in 2021, building further on the gains it already made
in 2020 when lock downs and work-from-home rules encouraged many
people to find ways to upgrade their internet access and
performance; the limited coverage of fixed-line broadband networks
makes mobile the first, if not only, choice for most people in the
country (2021)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line teledensity is about 11 per
100 persons; multiple providers of mobile-cellular service with a
subscribership of nearly 83 per 100 persons (2020)<br/>

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

stateless persons: 133,770 (2016); note - a
September 2013 Constitutional Court ruling revoked the citizenship
of those born after 1929 to immigrants without proper
documentation, even though the constitution at the time
automatically granted citizenship to children born in the Dominican
Republic and the 2010 constitution provides that constitutional
provisions cannot be applied retroactively; the decision
overwhelmingly affected people of Haitian descent whose relatives
had come to the Dominican Republic since the 1890s as a cheap
source of labor for sugar plantations; a May 2014 law passed by the
Dominican Congress regularizes the status of those with birth
certificates but will require those without them to prove they were
born in the Dominican Republic and to apply for naturalization; the
government has issued documents to thousands of individuals who may
claim citizenship under this law, but no official estimate has been
released</subsection>
