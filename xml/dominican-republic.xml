   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Taino - indigenous inhabitants of Hispaniola prior to the
arrival of Europeans - divided the island into five chiefdoms and
territories. Christopher COLUMBUS explored and claimed the island
on his first voyage in 1492; it became a springboard for Spanish
conquest of the Caribbean and the American mainland. In 1697, Spain
recognized French dominion over the western third of the island,
which in 1804 became Haiti. The remainder of the island, by then
known as Santo Domingo, sought to gain its own independence in 1821
but was conquered and ruled by the Haitians for 22 years; it
finally attained independence as the Dominican Republic in 1844. In
1861, the Dominicans voluntarily returned to the Spanish Empire,
but two years later they launched a war that restored independence
in 1865. A legacy of unsettled, mostly non-representative rule
followed, capped by the dictatorship of Rafael Leonidas TRUJILLO
from 1930 to 1961. Juan BOSCH was elected president in 1962 but was
deposed in a military coup in 1963. In 1965, the US led an
intervention in the midst of a civil war sparked by an uprising to
restore BOSCH. In 1966, Joaquin BALAGUER defeated BOSCH in the
presidential election. BALAGUER maintained a tight grip on power
for most of the next 30 years when international reaction to flawed
elections forced him to curtail his term in 1996. Since then,
regular competitive elections have been held in which opposition
candidates have won the presidency. Former President Leonel
FERNANDEZ Reyna (first term 1996-2000) won election to a new term
in 2004 following a constitutional amendment allowing presidents to
serve more than one term, and was later reelected to a second
consecutive term. Following the two-term presidency of Danilo
MEDINA Sanchez (2012-2020), Luis Rodolfo ABINADER Corona was
elected president in July 2020.</subsection>

red (hoist side) and ultramarine blue; a small coat of arms

branch (right) is at the center of the cross; above the shield a
blue ribbon displays the motto, DIOS, PATRIA, LIBERTAD (God,
Fatherland, Liberty), and below the shield, REPUBLICA DOMINICANA

         <note title="general assessment">the Dominican Republic’s telecom sector continued its solid form throughout 2020 and into 2021, shrugging off the economic turmoil unleashed by the Covid-19 pandemic to maintain a decade-long run of low but positive growth across all areas of the market; the Dominican Republic remains behind most of its counterparts in the Latin American region, especially in terms of fixed-line network coverage; mobile subscriptions are on par with the regional average, but at subscription levels of around 88% there is still ample opportunity for growth; in terms of growth, the standout winner was once again the mobile broadband segment; the market is expected to see close to 8% growth in 2021, building further on the gains it already made in 2020 when lock downs and work-from-home rules encouraged many people to find ways to upgrade their internet access and performance; the limited coverage of fixed-line broadband networks makes mobile the first, if not only, choice for most people in the country (2021)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>
