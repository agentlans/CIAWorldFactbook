   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Tajik people came under Russian imperial rule in the 1860s
and 1870s, but Russia's hold on Central Asia weakened following the
Revolution of 1917. At that time, bands of indigenous guerrillas
(known as "basmachi") fiercely contested Bolshevik control of the
area, which was not fully reestablished until 1925. Tajikistan was
first created as an autonomous republic within Uzbekistan in 1924,
but in 1929 the USSR designated Tajikistan a separate republic and
transferred to it much of present-day Sughd Province. Ethnic Uzbeks
form a substantial minority in Tajikistan, and ethnic Tajiks an
even larger minority in Uzbekistan. Tajikistan became independent
in 1991 following the breakup of the Soviet Union, and experienced
a civil war between political, regional, and religious factions
from 1992 to 1997.Though the country holds general elections for both the
presidency (once every seven years) and legislature (once every
five years), observers note an electoral system rife with
irregularities and abuse, with results that are neither free nor
fair. President Emomali RAHMON, who came to power in 1992 during
the civil war and was first elected president in 1994, used an
attack planned by a disaffected deputy defense minister in 2015 to
ban the last major opposition political party in Tajikistan. In
December 2015, RAHMON further strengthened his position by having
himself declared "Founder of Peace and National Unity, Leader of
the Nation," with limitless terms and lifelong immunity through
constitutional amendments ratified in a referendum. The referendum
also lowered the minimum age required to run for president from 35
to 30, which made RAHMON's first-born son Rustam EMOMALI, the mayor
of the capital city of Dushanbe, eligible to run for president in
2020. In April 2020, RAHMON orchestrated EMOMALI's selection as
chairman of the Majlisi Milli (Tajikistan's senate), positioning
EMOMALI as next in line of succession for the presidency. RAHMON
opted to run in the presidential election in October 2020 and
received 91% of the vote.<br/>

The country remains the poorest in the former Soviet sphere.
Tajikistan became a member of the WTO in March 2013. However, its
economy continues to face major challenges, including dependence on
remittances from Tajikistani migrant laborers working in Russia and
Kazakhstan, pervasive corruption, and the opiate trade and other
destabilizing violence emanating from neighboring Afghanistan.
Tajikistan has endured several domestic security incidents since
2010, including armed conflict between government forces and local
strongmen in the Rasht Valley and between government forces and
residents and informal leaders in Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous
Oblast. Tajikistan suffered its first ISIS-claimed attack in 2018,
when assailants attacked a group of Western bicyclists with
vehicles and knives, killing four.  </subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Tajikistan has a youthful age structure with almost 50% of the
population under the age of 25.  As a Soviet republic,
Tajikistan had the highest fertility rate in the Soviet
Union.  The total fertility rate – the average number of
births per woman – was highest in the mid-1970s, when it reached
6.3.  In an effort to expand populations to meet economic
goals, the Soviets provided resources that made large families
affordable.  The fertility rate decreased to 5 by the time of
independence in 1991 and continued to decline thereafter.  In
1996, the Tajik Government discontinued subsidies for large
families and having several children became too expensive. 
The loss of subsidies, the 5-year civil war that followed
independence, and other factors caused fertility to continue to
fall steadily, but it remains above replacement level at 2.5. 
The availability of healthcare providers and family planning
services is limited, contributing to couples having more children
than they would like.  As of 2017, 21% of women were using
contraceptives.Tajikistan’s ethnic make-up changed with the Soviet’s
introduction of industrialization.  Large numbers of Russian
and Ukrainian immigrants arrived in the mid-1920s. Some were forced
to immigrate while others came voluntarily to work in the cotton
industry and in Tajikistan’s Soviet Government.  The Russian
and Ukrainian immigrants formed urban communities, while Tajiks and
Uzbeks continued to live predominantly in rural areas.  In
addition, thousands of Tatars and Germans were deported to
Tajikistan, accused of Nazi complicity during WWII. Tajikistan’s ethnic composition was later shaped by the
post-independence civil war from 1992-1997 and the economic
devastation that followed.  Most non-Tajik ethnic groups,
including Uzbeks, Russians, Kyrgyz, and Ukrainians, fled to Russia
and other former Soviet republics and many never returned, making
the country overwhelming Tajik; approximately 80% of the population
was Tajik by 2000. Since the mid-1990s, labor has probably been Tajikistan’s main
export.  Remittances accounted for 30% of GDP in 2018 and are
Tajikistan’s largest source of external income.  Poverty, a
lack of jobs, and higher wages abroad push Tajiks to emigrate.
 Russia – particularly Moscow – is the main destination, while
a smaller number of religious Muslims, usually of Uzbek ancestry,
migrate to Uzbekistan.  The vast majority of labor migrants
are unskilled or low-skilled young men who work primarily in
construction but also agriculture, transportation, and
retail.  Many Tajik families are dependent on the money they
send home for necessities, such as food and clothing, as well as
for education and weddings rather than investment.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: the nation of Tajikistan
has had to struggle through a further two years of economic
hardship following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic; the strain
on financial resources inevitably means a continuation of the
absence of any meaningful investment or development programs for
telecommunications infrastructure; the fixed line telephony and
fixed broadband markets continue to languish far behind the mobile
sector in terms of teledensity and penetration; with only around
6,000 fixed broadband customers (0.07% penetration), there would
appear to be massive growth potential, but the limited fixed line
infrastructure in the country suggests there’s little likelihood of
that occurring any time soon; the size of Tajikistan’s mobile
market dwarfs the fixed line segment, with an estimated penetration
rate of nearly 120%; with a number of private sector companies
active in the mobile market, there been more commitment to
investment in network upgrades and expansion; three MNOs have all
launched commercial 5G services, initially in areas of the capital
city Dushanbe; the move towards higher speed mobile services should
further underpin the growth in the nascent mobile broadband market,
which is still estimated to be at a relatively low penetration
level of 42% (at least relative to most other Asian nations) but is
predicted to be a strong compound annual growth rate of more than
8% for at least the next five years (2021)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed line availability has not changed
significantly since 1998, while mobile cellular subscribership,
aided by competition among multiple operators, has expanded;
coverage now extends to all major cities and towns; fixed-line over
5 per 100 and mobile-cellular over 121 per 100 (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 992; linked by cable
and microwave radio relay to other CIS republics and by leased
connections to the Moscow international gateway switch; Dushanbe
linked by Intelsat to international gateway switch in Ankara
(Turkey); 3 satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat and 1
Orbita<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
