   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Autonomy for Eswatini was guaranteed by the British in the late
19th century; independence was granted in 1968. A new constitution
came into effect in 2006, which included provisions for a more
independent parliament and judiciary, but the legal status of
political parties remains unclear. King MSWATI III renamed the
country from Swaziland to Eswatini in April 2018. Despite its
classification as a lower-middle income country, Eswatini suffers
from severe poverty and high unemployment. Eswatini has the world's
highest HIV/AIDS prevalence rate, although recent years have shown
marked declines in new infections.    </subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Eswatini, a small, predominantly rural, landlocked country
surrounded by South Africa and Mozambique, suffers from severe
poverty and the world’s highest HIV/AIDS prevalence rate. A weak
and deteriorating economy, high unemployment, rapid population
growth, and an uneven distribution of resources all combine to
worsen already persistent poverty and food insecurity, especially
in rural areas. Erratic weather (frequent droughts and intermittent
heavy rains and flooding), overuse of small plots, the overgrazing
of cattle, and outdated agricultural practices reduce crop yields
and further degrade the environment, exacerbating Eswatini's
poverty and subsistence problems. Eswatini's extremely high
HIV/AIDS prevalence rate – nearly 28% of adults have the disease –
compounds these issues. Agricultural production has declined due to
HIV/AIDS, as the illness causes households to lose manpower and to
sell livestock and other assets to pay for medicine and
funerals.Swazis, mainly men from the country’s rural south, have been
migrating to South Africa to work in coal, and later gold, mines
since the late 19th century. Although the number of miners abroad
has never been high in absolute terms because of Eswatini's small
population, the outflow has had important social and economic
repercussions. The peak of mining employment in South Africa
occurred during the 1980s. Cross-border movement has accelerated
since the 1990s, as increasing unemployment has pushed more Swazis
to look for work in South Africa (creating a "brain drain" in the
health and educational sectors); southern Swazi men have continued
to pursue mining, although the industry has downsized. Women now
make up an increasing share of migrants and dominate cross-border
trading in handicrafts, using the proceeds to purchase goods back
in Eswatini. Much of today’s migration, however, is not
work-related but focuses on visits to family and friends, tourism,
and shopping.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">Eswatini was one of the last countries in the world to open up its telecom market to competition; until 2011 the state-owned Eswatini Posts and Telecommunications also acted as the industry regulator and had a stake in the country’s sole mobile network; a new independent regulatory authority was established in late 2013 and has since embarked on significant changes to the sector; mobile market subscriptions have been affected by the common use among subscribers when they use SIM cards from different networks in order to access cheaper on-net calls; subscriber growth has slowed in recent years, but was expected to have reached 8% in 2021, as people adapted to the changing needs for connectivity caused by the pandemic; the internet sector has been open to competition with a small number of licensed ISPs; DSL services were introduced in 2008, development of the sector has been hampered by the limited fixed-line infrastructure and by a lack of competition in the access and backbone networks; Eswatini is landlocked and so depends on neighboring countries for international bandwidth; this has meant that access pricing is relatively high, and market subscriptions remains relatively low; prices have fallen recently in line with greater bandwidth availability resulting from several new submarine cable systems which have reached the region in recent years; in September 2020 a terrestrial cable linked Mozambique with Eswatini and South Africa (2022)</note>
         <note title="domestic">Eswatini has 2 mobile-cellular providers; communication infrastructure has a geographic coverage of about 90% and a rising subscriber base; fixed-line stands at nearly 3 per 100 and mobile-cellular teledensity roughly 107 telephones per 100 persons; telephone system consists of carrier-equipped, open-wire lines and low-capacity, microwave radio relay (2020)</note>
         <note title="international">country code - 268; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean)</note>
         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>
