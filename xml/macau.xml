   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Colonized by the Portuguese in the 16th century, Macau was the
first European settlement in the Far East. Pursuant to an agreement
signed by China and Portugal on 13 April 1987, Macau became the
Macau Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of
China on 20 December 1999. In this agreement, China promised that,
under its "one country, two systems" formula, China's political and
economic system would not be imposed on Macau, and that Macau would
enjoy a "high degree of autonomy" in all matters except foreign
affairs and defense for the subsequent 50 years.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Macau’s economy and GDP
have been on a roller coaster ride since the start of the Covid-19
pandemic in 2020; the Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China
is heavily dependent on tourists coming from the mainland and Hong
Kong to play in Macau’s many casinos, but the ensuing lock downs
contributed to a dramatic fall in visitor numbers as well as
income; this too, has had a major effect on the telecom sector
(particularly in the mobile segment) with short-stay visitors as
well as foreign workers on temporary-stay visas being forced to
stay away.; total mobile subscription numbers are estimated to have
dropped from a high of 2.8 million in 2019 (representing a whopping
442% penetration rate in a region with a population of just
700,000) to less than half that by the end of 2021: 1.3 million
subscribers; Macau had almost the highest mobile penetration rate
in the world; it is now sitting at a more ‘reasonable’ level of
200%; a significant bounce back can be expected to follow the
easing of travel restrictions, although perhaps not up to the same
lofty heights achieved in 2019; asecond factor behind the steep
fall in 2020 was the introduction of a Cyber Security Law that
required all prepaid SIM cards to become registered or face being
deactivated in October 2020; the combined effect of the pandemic
and the new restrictions meant that prepaid subscriber numbers fell
by more than 80%; postpaid accounts, largely the domain of Macau’s
permanent residents, were barely affected by the external upheaval;
they continued to increase in number, year-on-year, and provided
better returns to the operators thanks to substantially increased
data usage during the lock downs; the mobile broadband market has
experienced the same dramatic fluctuations as the broader mobile
segment over the last two years, at least in terms of subscriber
numbers; but this is largely because mobile broadband uptake is
inextricably tied to the base mobile offering in Macau; with total
mobile broadband data traffic going up, not down, between 2019 and
2021, that again points to the strength of the contract segment
helping to drive future growth in Macau’s telecom sector

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

authorities convicted three sex traffickers but did not sentence
anyone to significant prison terms; authorities investigated only

not initiate any prosecutions or sentence convicted traffickers to
significant terms of imprisonment; Macau was downgraded to Tier 2

trafficking profile: Macau is a destination and,
to a much lesser extent, source for women and children subjected to
sex trafficking and possibly forced labor; most victims come from
the Chinese mainland, but others are trafficked from China, Russia,
and Southeast Asia; victims are lured in by false job offers and
forced into prostitution, often being confined to massage parlors
and illegal brothels where their identity documents are confiscated
and they are threatened with violence; Chinese, Russian, and Thai
criminal organizations are believed to be involved in recruiting
women for Macau’s commercial sex industry</subsection>
