      <subsection title="Background">A Malay trading port known as Temasek existed on the island of
Singapore by the 14th century. The settlement changed hands several
times in the ensuing centuries and was eventually burned in the
17th century and fell into obscurity. The British founded modern
Singapore as a trading colony on the site in 1819. It joined the
Malaysian Federation in 1963 but was ousted two years later and
became independent. Singapore subsequently became one of the
world's most prosperous countries with strong international trading
links (its port is one of the world's busiest in terms of tonnage
handled) and with per capita GDP equal to that of the leading
nations of Western Europe.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Singapore has one of the lowest total fertility rates (TFR) in
the world – an average of 1.15 children born per woman – and a
rapidly aging population.  Women’s expanded educations,
widened aspirations, and a desire to establish careers has
contributed to delayed marriage and smaller families. Most married
couples have only one or two children in order to invest more in
each child, including the high costs of education.  In
addition, more and more Singaporeans, particularly women, are
staying single.  Factors contributing to this trend are a
focus on careers, long working hours, the high cost of living, and
long waits for public housing.    With fertility at
such a low rate and rising life expectancy, the proportion of the
population aged 65 or over is growing and the youth population is
shrinking.  Singapore is projected to experience one of the
largest percentage point increases in the elderly share of the
population at 21% between 2019 and 2050, according to the UN. 
The working-age population (aged 15-64) will gradually decrease,
leaving fewer workers to economically support the elderly
population.Migration has played a key role in Singapore’s
development.  As Singapore’s economy expanded during the
19th century, more and more Chinese, Indian, and Malay
labor immigrants arrived.  Most of Singapore’s pre-World War
II population growth was a result of immigration.  During
World War II, immigration came to a halt when the Japanese occupied
the island but revived in the postwar years.  Policy was
restrictive during the 1950s and 1960s, aiming to protect jobs for
residents by reducing the intake of low-skilled foreign workers and
focusing instead on attracting professionals from abroad with
specialist skills.  Consequently, the nonresident share of
Singapore’s population plummeted to less than 3%. As the country industrialized, however, it loosened restrictions
on the immigration of manual workers.  From the 1980s through
the 2000s, the foreign population continued to grow as a result of
policies aimed at attracting foreign workers of all skill
levels.  More recently, the government has instituted
immigration policies that target highly skilled workers. Skilled
workers are encouraged to stay and are given the opportunity to
become permanent residents or citizens.  The country, however,
imposes restrictions on unskilled and low-skilled workers to ensure
they do not establish roots, including prohibiting them from
bringing their families and requiring employers to pay a monthly
foreign worker levy and security bond.  The country has also
become increasingly attractive to international students. The
growth of the foreign-born population has continued to be rapid; as
of 2015, the foreign-born composed 46% of the total
population.  At the same time, growing numbers of Singaporeans
are emigrating for education and work experience in highly skilled
sectors such finance, information technology, and medicine. 
Increasingly, the moves abroad are permanent.</subsection>
