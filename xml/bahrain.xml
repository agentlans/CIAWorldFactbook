   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">In 1783, the Sunni Al-KHALIFA family took power in Bahrain. In
order to secure these holdings, it entered into a series of
treaties with the UK during the 19th century that made Bahrain a
British protectorate. The archipelago attained its independence in
1971. A steady decline in oil production and reserves since 1970
prompted Bahrain to take steps to diversify its economy, in the
process developing petroleum processing and refining, aluminum
production, and hospitality and retail sectors. It has also
endeavored to become a leading regional banking center, especially
with respect to Islamic finance. Bahrain's small size, central
location among Gulf countries, economic dependence on Saudi Arabia,
and proximity to Iran require it to play a delicate balancing act
in foreign affairs among its larger neighbors. Its foreign policy
activities usually fall in line with Saudi Arabia and the UAE.The Sunni royal family has long struggled to manage relations
with its large Shia-majority population. In early 2011, amid Arab
uprisings elsewhere in the region, the Bahraini Government
confronted similar pro-democracy and reform protests at home with
police and military action, including deploying Gulf Cooperation
Council security forces to Bahrain. Failed political talks prompted
opposition political societies to boycott 2014 legislative and
municipal council elections. In 2018, a law preventing members of
political societies dissolved by the courts from participating in
elections effectively sidelined the majority of opposition figures
from taking part in national elections. As a result, most members
of parliament are independents. Ongoing dissatisfaction with the
political status quo continues to factor into sporadic clashes
between demonstrators and security forces. On 15 September 2020,
Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates signed peace agreements (the
Abraham Accords) with Israel – brokered by the US – in Washington
DC. Bahrain and the UAE thus became the third and fourth Middle
Eastern countries, along with Egypt and Jordan, to recognize
Israel.</subsection>

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
