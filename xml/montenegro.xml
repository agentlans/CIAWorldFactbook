   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The use of the name Crna Gora or Black Mountain (Montenegro)
began in the 13th century in reference to a highland region in the
Serbian province of Zeta. The later medieval state of Zeta
maintained its existence until 1496 when Montenegro finally fell
under Ottoman rule. Over subsequent centuries, Montenegro managed
to maintain a level of autonomy within the Ottoman Empire. From the
16th to 19th centuries, Montenegro was a theocracy ruled by a
series of bishop princes; in 1852, it transformed into a secular
principality. Montenegro was recognized as an independent sovereign
principality at the Congress of Berlin in 1878. After World War I,
during which Montenegro fought on the side of the Allies,
Montenegro was absorbed by the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and
Slovenes, which became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. At the
conclusion of World War II, it became a constituent republic of the
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. When the latter dissolved
in 1992, Montenegro joined with Serbia, creating the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia and, after 2003, shifting to a looser State
Union of Serbia and Montenegro. In May 2006, Montenegro invoked its
right under the Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro to
hold a referendum on independence from the two-state union. The
vote for severing ties with Serbia barely exceeded 55% - the
threshold set by the EU - allowing Montenegro to formally restore
its independence on 3 June 2006. In 2017, Montenegro joined NATO
and is currently completing its EU accession process, having
officially applied to join the EU in December 2008.</subsection>
