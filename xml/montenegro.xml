   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The use of the name Crna Gora or Black Mountain (Montenegro)
began in the 13th century in reference to a highland region in the
Serbian province of Zeta. The later medieval state of Zeta
maintained its existence until 1496 when Montenegro finally fell
under Ottoman rule. Over subsequent centuries, Montenegro managed
to maintain a level of autonomy within the Ottoman Empire. From the
16th to 19th centuries, Montenegro was a theocracy ruled by a
series of bishop princes; in 1852, it transformed into a secular
principality. Montenegro was recognized as an independent sovereign
principality at the Congress of Berlin in 1878. After World War I,
during which Montenegro fought on the side of the Allies,
Montenegro was absorbed by the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and
Slovenes, which became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. At the
conclusion of World War II, it became a constituent republic of the
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. When the latter dissolved
in 1992, Montenegro joined with Serbia, creating the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia and, after 2003, shifting to a looser State
Union of Serbia and Montenegro. In May 2006, Montenegro invoked its
right under the Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro to
hold a referendum on independence from the two-state union. The
vote for severing ties with Serbia barely exceeded 55% - the
threshold set by the EU - allowing Montenegro to formally restore
its independence on 3 June 2006. In 2017, Montenegro joined NATO
and is currently completing its EU accession process, having
officially applied to join the EU in December 2008.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: a small telecom market
supported by a population of only 623,000; fixed broadband services
are available via a variety of technology platforms, though fiber
is the dominant platform, accounting for almost 40% of connections;
the growth of fiber has largely been at the expense of DSL as
customers are migrated to fiber networks as these are built out
progressively; mobile penetration is particularly high, though this
is partly due to the significant number of tourists visiting the
country seasonally, as also to the popularity of subscribers having
multiple prepaid cards; in the wake of the pandemic and associated
restrictions on travel, the number of mobile subscribers fell in
2020, as also in the first quarter of 2021, year-on-year; networks
support a vibrant mobile broadband services sector, largely based
on LTE; two of the MNOs began trialing 5G in May 2021, though
commercial services will not gain traction until after the
multi-spectrum auction is completed at the end of 2021; spectrum is
available in the 694-790MHz and 3400-3800MHz ranges, as well as in
the 26.5-27.5GHz range (2021)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: GSM mobile-cellular service, available
through multiple providers; fixed-line over 30 per 100 and
mobile-cellular 172 per 100 persons (2020)<br/>

international: country code - 382; 2 international
switches connect the national system<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
