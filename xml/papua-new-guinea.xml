   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Papua New Guinea (PNG) was first settled between 50,000 and
60,000 years ago. PNG’s harsh geography consisting of mountains,
jungles, and numerous river valleys, kept many of the arriving
groups isolated, giving rise to PNG’s incredible ethnic and
linguistic diversity. Agriculture was independently developed by
some of these groups. Around 500 B.C., Austronesian voyagers
settled along the coast. Spanish and Portuguese explorers
periodically visited the island starting in the 1500s, but none
made it into the country’s interior. American and British whaling
ships frequented the islands off the coast of New Guinea in the
mid-1800s. In 1884, Germany declared a protectorate - and
eventually a colony - over the northern part of what would become
PNG and named it German New Guinea; days later the UK followed suit
on the southern part and nearby islands and called it Papua. Most
of their focus was on the coastal regions, leaving the highlands
largely unexplored.<br/>
         <br/>
The UK put its colony under Australian administration in 1902 and
formalized the act in 1906. At the outbreak of World War I,
Australia occupied German New Guinea and continued to rule it after
the war as a League of Nations Mandate. The discovery of gold along
the Bulolo River in the 1920s, led prospectors to venture into the
highlands, where they found about 1 million people living in
isolated communities. Japan invaded New Guinea in 1941 and reached
Papua the following year. Allied victories during the New Guinea
campaign pushed out the Japanese, and after the end of the war,
Australia combined the two territories into one administration. Sir
Michael SOMARE won elections in 1972 on the promise of achieving
independence, which was realized in 1975.<br/>
         <br/>
A secessionist movement in Bougainville, an island well endowed in
copper and gold resources, reignited in 1988 with debates about
land use, profits, and an influx of outsiders at the Panguna Copper
Mine. Following elections in 1992, the PNG Government took a
hardline stance against Bougainville rebels and the resulting civil
war led to about 20,000 deaths. In 1997, the PNG Government hired
mercenaries to support its troops in Bougainville, sparking an army
mutiny and forcing the prime minister to resign. PNG and
Bougainville signed a truce in 1997 and a peace agreement in 2001,
which granted Bougainville autonomy. An internationally-monitored
nonbinding referendum asking Bougainvilleans to chose independence
or greater self-rule occurred in November 2019, with 98% of voters
opting for independence.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: fixed-line teledensity in
Papua New Guinea has seen little change over the past two decades;
progress in the country’s telecom sector has come primarily from
mobile networks, where accessibility has expanded considerably in
recent years, with population coverage increasing from less than 3%
in 2006 to more than 90% by early 2021; the MNOs operate networks
offering services based on GSM, 3G, and LTE, depending on location;
GSM is prevalent in many rural and remote areas, while 3G and LTE
are centered more on urban areas; MNOs’ investments in 4G are
growing, though GSM still represents the bulk of all mobile
connections owing to the low penetration of smartphones and the
concentration of high-speed data networks predominantly in high
value urban areas; a lack of sufficient competition and investment
in the wire line segment has driven up prices and hampered network
coverage and quality; infrastructure deployment costs are high,
partly due to the relatively low subscriber base, the difficult
terrain, and the high proportion of the population living in rural
areas; fixed telecom infrastructure is almost non-existent outside
urban centers, leaving most of the population under served; PNG is
the Pacific region’s largest poorly developed telecom market, with
only around 22% of its people connected to the internet; this falls
far behind the recommended targets set in the country’s National
Broadband Policy drafted in 2013, which aimed to provide broadband
access to 90% of the total population by 2018; the existing
submarine cable infrastructure is insufficient to serve the
country’s needs; low international capacity has meant that internet
services are expensive and slow; the cable links PNG to the Solomon
Islands and Australia (landing at Sydney); despite the improvement
in recent years, the country is still impacted by a connectivity
infrastructure deficit, making it reliant on more expensive
alternatives such as satellites, also weighing on the affordability
of services for end-users (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: access to telephone services is not
widely available; fixed-line nearly 2 per 100 and mobile-cellular
nearly 54 per 100 persons (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 675; landing points
for the Kumul Domestic Submarine Cable System, PNG-LNG, APNG-2,
CSCS and the PPC-1 submarine cables to Australia, Guam, PNG
and Solomon Islands; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Pacific
Ocean) (2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

native soldiers and led by Australian officers and non-commissioned
officers formed during World War II to help fight the Japanese; the
RPIR was disbanded after the war, but reestablished in 1951 as part
of the Australian Army where it continued to serve until Papua New

fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking
and is not making significant efforts to do so; despite remaining
at Tier 3, the government continued to identify some trafficking
victims and a prominent trafficking case was advanced; however, the
government did not provide protective services for victims and did
not systematically implement its victim identification procedures;
corruption among officials in the logging sector remains a problem,
and they continue to facilitate sex trafficking and forced labor;
no alleged traffickers were convicted; the government dedicates
little financial and human resources to combat trafficking, and
awareness of trafficking is low among government officials

trafficking profile: Papua New Guinea is a source,
destination, and transit country for men, women, and children
subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor; women and children
are subjected to sex trafficking and domestic servitude; families
may sell girls into forced marriages to settle debts, leaving them
vulnerable to forced domestic service; local and Chinese men are
forced to labor in logging and mining camps; migrant women from
Malaysia, Thailand, China, and the Philippines are subjected to sex
trafficking and domestic servitude at logging and mining camps,
fisheries, and entertainment sites</subsection>
