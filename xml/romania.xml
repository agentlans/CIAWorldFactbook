   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia - for centuries
under the suzerainty of the Turkish Ottoman Empire - secured their
autonomy in 1856; they were de facto linked in 1859 and formally
united in 1862 under the new name of Romania. The country gained
recognition of its independence in 1878. It joined the Allied
Powers in World War I and acquired new territories - most notably
Transylvania - following the conflict. In 1940, Romania allied with
the Axis powers and participated in the 1941 German invasion of the
USSR. Three years later, overrun by the Soviets, Romania signed an
armistice. The post-war Soviet occupation led to the formation of a
communist "people's republic" in 1947 and the abdication of the
king. The decades-long rule of dictator Nicolae CEAUSESCU, who took
power in 1965, and his Securitate police state became increasingly
oppressive and draconian through the 1980s. CEAUSESCU was
overthrown and executed in late 1989. Former communists dominated
the government until 1996 when they were swept from power. Romania
joined NATO in 2004 and the EU in 2007.</subsection>

has undergone several significant changes in recent years; the
mobile market is served by network operators that have extensive
LTE networks in place, while services based on 5G have been offered
under their existing spectrum concessions since 2019; the delayed
multi-spectrum auction, expected to be completed later in 2021,
will enable the operators to expand 5G network capacity and enable
consumers to make far greater use of the technology’s potential; in
line with legislation passed in July 2021 the MNOs will have to
replace equipment provided by vendors deemed to be a security risk
(2021)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line teledensity is about 16
telephones per 100 persons; mobile market served by four mobile
network operators; mobile-cellular teledensity over 117 telephones
per 100 persons (2020)<br/>

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
