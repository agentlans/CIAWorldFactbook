   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Modern-day Laos has its roots in the ancient Lao kingdom of Lan
Xang, established in the 14th century under King FA NGUM. For 300
years Lan Xang had influence reaching into present-day Cambodia and
Thailand, as well as over all of what is now Laos. After centuries
of gradual decline, Laos came under the domination of Siam
(Thailand) from the late 18th century until the late 19th century,
when it became part of French Indochina. The Franco-Siamese Treaty
of 1907 defined the current Lao border with Thailand. In 1975, the
communist Pathet Lao took control of the government, ending a
six-century-old monarchy and instituting a strict socialist regime
closely aligned to Vietnam. A gradual, limited return to private
enterprise and the liberalization of foreign investment laws began
in 1988. Laos became a member of ASEAN in 1997 and the WTO in
2013.<br/>
         <br/>
In the 2010s, the country benefited from direct foreign investment,
particularly in the natural resource and industry sectors.
Construction of a number of large hydropower dams and expanding
mining activities have also boosted the economy. Laos has retained
its official commitment to communism and maintains close ties with
its two communist neighbors, Vietnam and China, both of which
continue to exert substantial political and economic influence on
the country. China, for example, provided 70% of the funding for a
$5.9 billion, 400-km railway line between the Chinese border and
the capital Vientiane, which opened for operations in December
2021. Laos financed the remaining 30% with loans from China. At the
same time, Laos has expanded its economic reliance on the West and
other Asian countries, such as Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan,
and Thailand.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Laos is a predominantly rural country with a youthful population
– almost 55% of the population is under the age of 25.  Its
progress on health and development issues has been uneven
geographically, among ethnic groups, and socioeconomically. 
Laos has made headway in poverty reduction, with the poverty rate
almost halving from 46% in 1992/93 to 22% in 2012/13. 
Nevertheless, pronounced rural-urban disparities persist, and
income inequality is rising.  Poverty most affects populations
in rural and highland areas, particularly ethnic minority
groups. The total fertility rate (TFR) has decreased markedly from
around 6 births per woman on average in 1990 to approximately 2.8
in 2016, but it is still one of the highest in Southeast Asia.
 TFR is higher in rural and remote areas, among ethnic
minority groups, the less-educated, and the poor; it is lower in
urban areas and among the more educated and those with higher
incomes.  Although Laos’ mortality rates have improved
substantially over the last few decades, the maternal mortality
rate and childhood malnutrition remain at high levels.  As
fertility and mortality rates continue to decline, the proportion
of Laos’ working-age population will increase, and its share of
dependents will shrink.  The age structure shift will provide
Laos with the potential to realize a demographic dividend during
the next few decades, if it can improve educational access and
quality and gainfully employ its growing working-age population in
productive sectors.  Currently, Laos primary school enrollment
is nearly universal, but the drop-out rate remains
problematic.  Secondary school enrollment has also increased
but remains low, especially for girls. Laos has historically been a country of emigration and internal
displacement due to conflict and a weak economy. The Laos civil war
(1953 – 1975) mainly caused internal displacement (numbering in the
hundreds of thousands).  Following the end of the Vietnam War
in 1975, indigenous people in remote, war-struck areas were
resettled and more than 300,000 people fled to Thailand to escape
the communist regime that took power.  The majority of those
who sought refuge in Thailand ultimately were resettled in the US
(mainly Hmong who fought with US forces), and lesser numbers went
to France, Canada, and Australia. The Laos Government carried out resettlement programs between
the mid-1980s and mid-1990s to relocate ethnic minority groups from
the rural northern highlands to development areas in the lowlands
ostensibly to alleviate poverty, make basic services more
accessible, eliminate slash-and-burn agriculture and opium
production, integrate ethnic minorities, and control rebel groups
(including Hmong insurgents).  For many, however, resettlement
has exacerbated poverty, led to the loss of livelihoods, and
increased food insecurity and mortality rates.  As the
resettlement programs started to wane in the second half of the
1990s, migration from the northern highlands to urban centers –
chiefly the capital Vientiane – to pursue better jobs in the
growing manufacturing and service sectors became the main type of
relocation.  Migration of villagers from the south seeking
work in neighboring Thailand also increased.  Thailand is the
main international migration destination for Laotians because of
the greater availability of jobs and higher pay than at home;
nearly a million Laotian migrants were estimated to live in
Thailand as of 2015.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Laos joined the World Trade
Organization (WTO) in 2013; one of the conditions of admittance was
to establish an independent regulator for its telecom sector within
two years; the government had committed to do so by February 2015
as part of the accession agreement; there still has been no sign of
any firm plans being made to create an independent regulatory body;
the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) retains the
primary role in regulating the country’s telecom market; with the
government also having a financial stake (in part or in whole) in
every one of the major fixed-line and mobile operators, the MPT’s
position and decision-making is far from what could be considered
independent; sufficient returns on investment cannot be guaranteed
with such strict pricing controls as well as the potential for
political interference; fixed-line and mobile penetration levels
have, as a result, remained much lower than what’s seen in
neighboring South East Asian markets; there are signs of growth in
the mobile broadband segment as LTE network coverage slowly widens
and, more recently, the country’s first 5G services start to come
on stream; residents in the capital will at least be able to enjoy
high-speed services in the near future, while the rest of the
country waits patiently to catch up with the rest of the world.

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
