   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Gabon, a sparsely populated country known for its dense
rainforests and vast petroleum reserves, is one of the most
prosperous and stable countries in central Africa. Approximately 40
ethnic groups are represented, the largest of which is the Fang, a
group that covers the northern third of Gabon and expands north
into Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon. From about the early 1300s,
various kingdoms emerged in and surrounding present-day Gabon,
including the Kingdoms of Loango and Orungu. Because most early
Bantu languages spoken in these kingdoms did not have a written
form, historical traditions were passed on orally, resulting in
much of Gabon's early history being lost over time. Portuguese
traders who arrived in the mid-1400s gave the area its name of
Gabon. At that time, indigenous trade networks began to engage with
European traders, exchanging goods such as ivory and wood. For a
century beginning in the 1760s, trade came to focus mostly on
enslaved people. While many groups in Gabon participated in the
slave trade, the Fang were a notable exception. As the slave trade
declined in the late 1800s, France colonized the country and
directed a widespread extraction of Gabonese resources.
Anti-colonial rhetoric by Gabon’s educated elites increased
significantly in the early 1900s, but no widespread rebellion
materialized. French decolonization following World War II led to
the country’s independence in 1960.Within a year of independence, the government changed from a
parliamentary to a presidential system, and Leon M’BA won the first
presidential election in 1961. El Hadj Omar BONGO Ondimba - one of
the longest ruling heads of state in history - was M’BA’s vice
president and assumed the presidency after M’BA’s death in 1967.
BONGO went on to dominate the country's political scene for four
decades (1967-2009). In 1968, he declared Gabon a single-party
state and created the Parti Democratique Gabonais (PDG), which
remains the predominant party in Gabonese politics today. In the
early 1990s, he reintroduced a multiparty system under a new
constitution after he was confronted with growing political
opposition. He was reelected by wide margins in 1995, 1998, 2002,
and 2005 against a divided opposition and amidst allegations of
fraud. Following President BONGO's death in 2009, a new election
brought his son, Ali BONGO Ondimba, to power. President Ali BONGO
Ondimba was reelected in 2016 in a close election against a united
opposition. Gabon’s Constitutional Court reviewed the contested
election results and ruled in his favor.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Gabon’s oil revenues have given it one of the highest per capita
income levels in Sub-Saharan Africa, but the wealth is not evenly
distributed and poverty is widespread. Unemployment is especially
prevalent among the large youth population; more than 60% of the
population is under the age of 25 as of 2020. With a fertility rate
still averaging more than 3 children per woman, the youth
population will continue to grow and further strain the mismatch
between Gabon’s supply of jobs and the skills of its labor
force.Gabon has been a magnet to migrants from neighboring countries
since the 1960s because of the discovery of oil, as well as the
country’s political stability and timber, mineral, and natural gas
resources. Nonetheless, income inequality and high unemployment
have created slums in Libreville full of migrant workers from
Senegal, Nigeria, Cameroon, Benin, Togo, and elsewhere in West
Africa. In 2011, Gabon declared an end to refugee status for 9,500
remaining Congolese nationals to whom it had granted asylum during
the Republic of the Congo’s civil war between 1997 and 2003. About
5,400 of these refugees received permits to reside in Gabon.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: the telecom market was
liberalized in 1999 when the government awarded three mobile
telephony licenses and two ISP licenses and established an
independent regulatory authority; in contrast with the mobile
market, Gabon’s fixed-line and internet sectors have remained
underdeveloped due to a lack of competition and high prices; the
country has sufficient international bandwidth on the
SAT-3/WASC/SAFE submarine cable; the arrival of the ACE submarine
cable, combined with progressing work on the CAB cable, has
increased back haul capacity supporting mobile data traffic
(2022)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line is a little over 1 per 100
subscriptions; a growing mobile cellular network with multiple
providers is making telephone service more widely available with
mobile cellular teledensity at nearly 139 per 100 persons

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

total number of 81 incidents in 2020, it included the one hijacking

attempted boarding to steal valuables from ships and crews are the
most common types of incidents, almost a third of all incidents
involve a hijacking and/or kidnapping; in 2021, 57 crew members
were kidnapped in seven separate incidents in the Gulf of Guinea,
representing 100% of kidnappings worldwide; Nigerian pirates in
particular are well armed and very aggressive, operating as far as
