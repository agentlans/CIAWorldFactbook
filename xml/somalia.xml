   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Ancient Egypt trade expeditions along the northeastern coast of
Africa - including today's Eritrea, Djibouti, and Somalia -
occurred at various times between the 25th and 12th centuries B.C.
Between A.D. 800 and 1100, immigrant Muslim Arabs and Persians set
up coastal trading posts along the Gulf of Aden and the Indian
Ocean, solidifying Somalia’s close trading relationship with the
Arab Peninsula. In the late 19th century, Britain and Italy
established colonies in the Somali Peninsula, where they remained
until 1960, when British Somaliland gained independence and joined
with Italian Somaliland to form the Republic of Somalia. The
country functioned as a parliamentary democracy until 1969, when
General Mohamed SIAD Barre took control in a coup, beginning a
22-year authoritarian socialist dictatorship. In an effort to
centralize power, SIAD called for the eradication of the clan, the
key cultural and social organizing principle in Somali society.
Resistance to SIAD’s socialist leadership, which was causing a
rapid deterioration of the country, prompted allied clan militias
to overthrow SIAD in early 1991, resulting in state collapse.
Subsequent fighting between rival clans for resources and territory
overwhelmed the country, resulting in a manmade famine and
prompting international intervention. Beginning in 1993, the UN
spearheaded a humanitarian mission supported by international
forces, but the international community largely withdrew by 1995
following an incident that became known as Black Hawk Down in which
two American Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters were shot down
in Mogadishu. The fighting and subsequent siege and rescue resulted
in 21 deaths and 82 wounded among the international forces.<br/>
         <br/>
International peace conferences in the 2000s resulted in a number
of transitional governments that operated outside of Somalia. Left
largely to themselves, Somalis in the country established
alternative governance structures; some areas formed their own
administrations, such as Somaliland and Puntland, while others
developed localized institutions. Many local populations turned to
using sharia courts, an Islamic judicial system that implements
religious law. Several of these courts came together in 2006 to
form the Islamic Courts Union (ICU). The ICU established order in
many areas of central and southern Somalia, including Mogadishu,
but was forced out when Ethiopia intervened militarily in December
2006 on behalf of the Somali Transitional Federal Government (TFG).
While the TFG settled in the capital, the ICU fled to rural areas
or from Somalia altogether, reemerging less than a year later as
the Islamic insurgent and terrorist movement al-Shabaab, which is
still active today. In January 2007, the African Union (AU)
established the AU Mission in Somalia peacekeeping force, which
allowed Ethiopia to withdraw its forces, took over security
responsibility for the country, and gave the TFG space to develop
Somalia’s new government. By 2012, Somali powerbrokers agreed on a
provisional constitution with a loose federal structure and
established a central government in Mogadishu termed the Somali
Federal Government (SFG). Since then, several interim regional
administrations have been established and there have been two
presidential elections. However, significant and fundamental
governance and security problems remain for the SFG since
al-Shabaab controls large portions of the country.<br/>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Somalia scores very low for most humanitarian indicators,
suffering from poor governance, protracted internal conflict,
underdevelopment, economic decline, poverty, social and gender
inequality, and environmental degradation. Despite civil war and
famine raising its mortality rate, Somalia’s high fertility rate
and large proportion of people of reproductive age maintain rapid
population growth, with each generation being larger than the prior
one. More than 60% of Somalia’s population is younger than 25 as of
2020, and the fertility rate is among the world’s highest at almost
5.5 children per woman – a rate that has decreased little since the
1970s.A lack of educational and job opportunities is a major source of
tension for Somalia’s large youth cohort, making them vulnerable to
recruitment by extremist and pirate groups. Somalia has one of the
world’s lowest primary school enrollment rates – just over 40% of
children are in school – and one of the world’s highest youth
unemployment rates. Life expectancy is low as a result of high
infant and maternal mortality rates, the spread of preventable
diseases, poor sanitation, chronic malnutrition, and inadequate
health services.During the two decades of conflict that followed the fall of the
SIAD regime in 1991, hundreds of thousands of Somalis fled their
homes. Today Somalia is the world’s fourth highest source country
for refugees, after Ukraine, Syria and Afghanistan. Insecurity,
drought, floods, food shortages, and a lack of economic
opportunities are the driving factors.As of 2022, more than 660,000 Somali refugees were hosted in the
region, mainly in Kenya, Yemen, Egypt, Ethiopia, Djibouti, and
Uganda, while nearly 3 million Somalis were internally displaced.
Since the implementation of a tripartite voluntary repatriation
agreement among Kenya, Somalia, and the UNHCR in 2013, many Somali
refugees have returned home, some 80,000 between 2014 and
2022.  The Kenyan Government in March 2021 ordered the closure
of its two largest refugee camps, Dadaab and Kakuma, which then
hosted more than 410,000 mainly Somali refugees.  However, the
UN refugee agency presented a road map, including voluntary
repatriation, relocation to third countries, and alternative stay
options that persuaded the Kenyan Government to delay the
closures.  The plan was supposed to lead to both camps being
closed by 30 June 2022. Yet, as of May 2022, few Somali refugees
had decided to return home because of security concerns and the
lack of job prospects, instead waiting in the camps unsure of what
the future held for them. Other Somali asylum seekers brave the
dangers of crossing the Gulf of Aden to reach Yemen – despite its
internal conflict – with aspirations to move onward to Saudi Arabia
and other locations.</subsection>

the CDC recommends that before any international travel, anyone

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Somalia’s economic
difficulties in recent years have made it difficult for telcos and
the government to sustain investment in infrastructure; the
government has also had to contend with militant groups which
continue on occasion to force the closure of internet services in
many areas of the country; in recent years, though, the government
has addressed the lack of guidance which had prevailed since 1991,
when a dictatorial regime was overthrown; the National
Communications Law was passed in October 2017, aimed at setting a
legal and regulatory framework for the telecoms sector, while
provision was made in the following year to set up a regulatory
authority to oversee the telecom sector; more recently, three types
of licenses were mandated to provide clarity to operators, and to
bring the market closer into line with international standards; all
operators were given until August 2020 to secure one of the three
license types; given the poor condition of fixed-line
infrastructure, operators have concentrated on mobile connectivity;
their investment plans have involved the development of LTE
services to provide mobile data and broadband services; the telecom
market has flourished; tariffs are among the lowest in Africa, and
new cable systems coming on stream in the next few years, as well
as planned investments from local operators to bolster the
country’s national fiber backbone, will lead to downward pressure
on retail pricing; on the consumer side, spending on telecoms
services and devices are under pressure from the financial effect
of large-scale job losses and the consequent restriction on
disposable incomes as the remnants of the impact of the Covid-19
pandemic remain and as global events, such as the Russian invasion
of Ukraine, continue to play out; the market is continuing a
positive growth trajectory, supported by a slow economic rebound in
the country (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: seven networks compete for customers in
the mobile sector; some of these mobile-service providers offer
fixed-lines and Internet services; fixed-line is less than 1 per
100 and mobile-cellular roughly 56 per 100 (2020)<br/>

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

unit and a Turkish-trained commando unit known as Harmacad, or
Cheetah); National Security and Intelligence Agency (includes a
commando/counterterrorism unit) (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
note 1: Somalia has numerous militia and regional
forces operating throughout the country; these forces include ones
that are clan- and warlord-based, semi-official paramilitary and
special police forces (aka darwish), and externally-sponsored
militias; the SNA is attempting to incorporate some of these
militia units<br/>

         <br/>
note 1: in January 2023, the Somali Government
said the SNA would have 24,000 trained and equipped troops by
2024<br/>
         <br/>
note 2: as of 2022, there were estimates of up to
50,000 militia forces operating in the country</subsection>
      <subsection title="Military equipment inventories and acquisitions">the SNA is lightly armed with an inventory that includes a
variety of older, secondhand equipment largely from Italy, Russia,
South Africa, and the UK; in recent years, it has received small
quantities of equipment as aid/donations from a variety of
countries, including the US (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
note: in 2022, the UN voted to maintain an arms
embargo on Somali in place since 1992; however, the embargo was
modified to reflect the Somali Government’s progress in improving
its management of weapons and ammunition; it includes allowing
Somalia to import portable surface-to-air missiles, higher-caliber
mortars, anti-tank guided weapons, some aircraft and vessels
designed or modified for military use, and combat drones for use by
its security forces and police — unless the Security Council
committee monitoring sanctions objects within five working days of
receiving notification from the Somali Government</subsection>
      <subsection title="Military service age and obligation">18 is the legal minimum age for compulsory and voluntary
military service; conscription is authorized but not currently
utilized; women may volunteer (2021)<br/>
         <br/>
note: in 2019, the Federal Government of Somalia
renewed its commitment to end the recruitment and use of child
soldiers by signing a roadmap detailing measures and practical
actions to prevent violations against children, release children
associated with armed forces, and reintegrate them into
communities; the signing followed a similar accord committed to
ending the use of child soldiers signed by both the Somali
Transitional Government and the UN in 2012</subsection>
      <subsection title="Military - note">the Somali National Army (SNA) and supporting security and
militia forces are actively conducting operations against the
al-Shabaab terrorist group (see <br/>Appendix
T); al-Shabaab controls large parts of southern and central
Somalia <br/>
         <br/>
of the SNA’s approximately 13 brigades, the most effective are
assessed to be the US-trained Danab ("Lightning") Advanced Infantry
Brigade and those of the Turkish-trained Gorgor ("Eagle") Special
Division; as of 2022, the Danab Brigade numbered about 1,500 troops
with an eventual projected strength of 3,000, while the Gorgor
Division was estimated to have up to 5,000 trained troops; the
Somali Government has sent thousands of troops to Eritrea and
Uganda for training and in 2023 announced plans to send additional
personnel to Egypt and Ethiopia for training<br/>
         <br/>
the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) operated in the
country with the approval of the UN from 2007-2022; its
peacekeeping mission included assisting Somali forces in providing
security for a stable political process, enabling the gradual
handing over of security responsibilities from AMISOM to the Somali
security forces, and reducing the threat posed by al-Shabaab and
other armed opposition groups; in April 2022, AMISOM was
reconfigured and replaced with the AU Transition Mission in Somalia
(ATMIS); the ATMIS mission is to support the Somalia Federal
Government (FGS) in implementing the security objectives of the
FGS's security transition plan, a comprehensive strategy developed
by the FGS and its international partners in 2018 and updated in
2021 to gradually transfer security responsibilities from ATMIS to
Somali security forces; ATMIS is projected to gradually reduce
staffing from its 2022 level of about 20,000 personnel (civilians,
military, and police) to zero by the end of 2024<br/>
         <br/>
UN Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM; established 2013) is
mandated by the Security Council to work with the FGS to support
national reconciliation, provide advice on peace-building and
state-building, monitor the human rights situation, and help
coordinate the efforts of the international community; the UN
Support Office in Somalia (UNSOS; established 2015) is responsible
for providing logistical field support to ATMIS, UNSOM, and the
Somali security forces on joint operations with ATMIS<br/>
         <br/>
the European Union Training Mission in Somalia (EUTM-S) has
operated in the country since 2010; the EUTM provides advice and
training to the Somali military; the US, UK, and Turkey maintain
separate military training missions in Somalia (the US has also
supported the SNA with air strikes); the UAE maintains a military
presence in Somaliland (2023)</subsection>
      <subsection title="Maritime threats">the International Maritime Bureau’s (IMB) Piracy Reporting
Center (PRC) received one incident of piracy and armed robbery in
2021 for the Horn of Africa; while there were no recorded
incidents, the IMB PRC warns that Somalia pirates continue to
possess the capacity to carry out attacks in the Somali basin and
wider Indian Ocean; in particular, the report warns that, "Masters
and crew must remain vigilant and cautious when transiting these
waters."; the presence of several naval task forces in the Gulf of
Aden and additional anti-piracy measures on the part of ship
operators, including the use of on-board armed security teams,
contributed to the drop in incidents; the EU naval mission,
Operation ATALANTA, continues its operations in the Gulf of Aden
and Indian Ocean through 2022; naval units from China, India,
Japan, Pakistan, South Korea, the US, and other countries also
operate in conjunction with EU forces</subsection>

Somalia and routed Islamist Courts from Mogadishu in January 2007;
the border between the Ogaden region of eastern Ethiopia, which is
inhabited by ethnic Somalis, and Somalia is only partially
demarcated under colonial rule and has been the source of tension
for decadesSomalia-Kenya: Kenya works hard to prevent the clan and
militia fighting in Somalia from spreading south across the border,
which has long been open to nomadic pastoralists; in 2015, the
Kenyan Government began building a wall along the border to prevent
the crossborder movement of militant groups; the boundary separates
ethnic Somalis; in October 2021, the Somalia-Kenya Indian Ocean
boundary dispute was decided by the International Court of Justice;
the ruling adjusted the boundary slightly north of Somalia’s claim
giving Somalia the majority of the contested maritime territory,
which is believed to contain rich oil and natural gas deposits;
while the decision is legally binding, it has no enforcement
mechanism, and Kenya has said it will not abide by it</subsection>
