   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The region of present day Georgia contained the ancient kingdoms
of Colchis and Kartli-Iberia. The area came under Roman influence
in the first centuries A.D., and Christianity became the state
religion in the 330s. Domination by Persians, Arabs, and Turks was
followed by a Georgian golden age (11th-13th centuries) that was
cut short by the Mongol invasion of 1236. Subsequently, the Ottoman
and Persian empires competed for influence in the region. Georgia
was absorbed into the Russian Empire in the 19th century.
Independent for three years (1918-1921) following the Russian
revolution, it was forcibly incorporated into the USSR in 1921 and
regained its independence when the Soviet Union dissolved in
1991.Mounting public discontent over rampant corruption and
ineffective government services, followed by an attempt by the
incumbent Georgian Government to manipulate parliamentary elections
in November 2003, touched off widespread protests that led to the
resignation of Eduard SHEVARDNADZE, president since 1995. In the
aftermath of that popular movement, which became known as the "Rose
Revolution," new elections in early 2004 swept Mikheil SAAKASHVILI
into power along with his United National Movement (UNM) party.
SAAKASHVILI made progress on market reforms and good governance
during his time in power but also faced accusations of abuse of
office. Progress was also complicated by Russian assistance and
support to the separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia
that led to periodic flare-ups in tension and violence and that
culminated in a five-day conflict in August 2008 between Russia and
Georgia, including the invasion of large portions of Georgian
territory. Russian troops pledged to pull back from most occupied
Georgian territory, but in late August 2008 Russia unilaterally
recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and
Russian military forces remain in those regions.Billionaire Bidzina IVANISHVILI's unexpected entry into politics
in October 2011 brought the divided opposition together under his
Georgian Dream coalition, which won a majority of seats in the
October 2012 parliamentary elections and removed UNM from power.
Conceding defeat, SAAKASHVILI named IVANISHVILI as prime minister
and allowed Georgian Dream to create a new government. Giorgi
MARGVELASHVILI became president in November 2013, ending a tense
year of power-sharing between SAAKASHVILI and IVANISHVILI and
SAAKASHVILI then left the country. At the time, these changes in
leadership represented unique examples of a former Soviet state
that emerged to conduct democratic and peaceful government
transitions of power. IVANISHVILI voluntarily resigned from office
after the presidential succession, and in the following years, the
prime minister position has seen frequent turnover. Most recently,
Irakli GARIBASHVILI became prime minister in February 2021,
replacing Giorgi GAKHARIA, who later in the year formed his own
opposition party. In October 2021, SAAKASHVILI returned to Georgia,
where he was immediately arrested to serve six years in prison on
outstanding abuse of office convictions. Popular and government
support for integration with the West is high in Georgia. Joining
the EU and NATO are among the country's top foreign policy
goals.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Analyzing population trends in Georgia since independence in
1991 has proven difficult due to a lack of reliable demographic
statistics.  Censuses were fairly accurately and regularly
updated through a vital statistics system during Georgia’s period
of Soviet rule, but from independence until about 2010, the system
broke down as a result of institutional and economic change, social
unrest, and large-scale outmigration.  The 2002 census is
believed to have significantly overestimated the size of Georgia’s
population, in part because respondents continued to include
relatives living abroad as part of their household count.  The
2014 census indicates that Georgia’s population is decreasing and
aging.  Census data shows that the median age increased from
34.5 years in 2002 to 37.7 years in 2014.  The working-age
population (ages 15-65 years) was fairly high in 2002 and rose
between 2005 and 2011. Nonetheless, Georgia did not reap economic
benefits from this age structure, since the working-age population
increase seems to have stimulated labor outmigration to Russia,
Ukraine, and other neighboring countries.Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Georgia has seen
its economy grow to its highest level in years due to the influx of
Russian businesses, information and communications technology
specialists, and money transfers.  This growth may only be
temporary and conditions could still easily change depending on
future events.  Meanwhile, the Russian inflow is also a source
of concern, as some Georgians fear it could prompt Putin to target
their country next.  In addition, Ukrainian refugees use
Georgia not just as a transit country but also as a
destination.  Some 25,000 Ukrainians remain in the country as
of November 2022; they pose an additional strain on resources in
Georgia, which has a significant population of its own displaced
citizens – from the 2008 Russian occupation of Abkhazia and South
Ossetia – who continue to need government support.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: the telecom sector has been
attempting for many years to overcome the decades of
under-investment in its fixed-line infrastructure during the Soviet
era; concerted efforts to privatize state-owned enterprises and
open up the telecom market have been mostly successful, with a
large number of networks now competing in both the fixed-line and
the mobile segments; more needs to be done, however, to give
investors the confidence to enter a market that has barely moved in
terms of revenue growth over the last decade, and where regulatory
overreach has sometimes come perilously close to arresting further
development; Georgia’s government moved fast following the collapse
of the Soviet Union to liberalize the country’s telecom market;
this resulted in a relatively high number of networks competing in
the under-developed fixed-line segment as well as in the emerging
mobile market; both segments remain dominated by just a few
companies (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line subscriptions over 9 per 100,
cellular telephone networks cover the entire country;
mobile-cellular teledensity roughly 128 per 100 persons; intercity
facilities include a fiber-optic line between T'bilisi and
K'ut'aisi; the mobile and mobile broadband segments have both
demonstrated solid growth in 2021, (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 995; landing points
for the Georgia-Russia, Diamond Link Global, and Caucasus Cable
System fiber-optic submarine cable that provides connectivity to
Russia, Romania and Bulgaria; international service is available by
microwave, landline, and satellite through the Moscow switch;
international electronic mail and telex service are available
(2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
