   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Once part of Spain's vast empire in the New World, Honduras
became an independent nation in 1821. After two and a half decades
of mostly military rule, a freely elected civilian government came
to power in 1982. During the 1980s, Honduras proved a haven for
anti-Sandinista contras fighting the Marxist Nicaraguan Government
and an ally to Salvadoran Government forces fighting leftist
guerrillas. The country was devastated by Hurricane Mitch in 1998,
which killed about 5,600 people and caused approximately $2 billion
in damage. Since then, the economy has slowly rebounded, despite
COVID and severe storm-related setbacks in 2020 and 2021.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Honduras is one of the poorest countries in Latin America and
has one of the world's highest murder rates. More than half of the
population lives in poverty and per capita income is one of the
lowest in the region. Poverty rates are higher among rural and
indigenous people and in the south, west, and along the eastern
border than in the north and central areas where most of Honduras'
industries and infrastructure are concentrated. The increased
productivity needed to break Honduras' persistent high poverty rate
depends, in part, on further improvements in educational
attainment. Although primary-school enrollment is near 100%,
educational quality is poor, the drop-out rate and grade repetition
remain high, and teacher and school accountability is low.Honduras' population growth rate has slowed since the 1990s and
is now 1.2% annually with a birth rate that averages 2.1 children
per woman and more among rural, indigenous, and poor women.
Honduras' young adult population - ages 15 to 29 - is projected to
continue growing rapidly for the next three decades and then
stabilize or slowly shrink. Population growth and limited job
prospects outside of agriculture will continue to drive emigration.

by an unstable political framework which has rendered telecom
sector reform difficult; this has created real difficulties for
telcos as well as consumers; fixed-line teledensity, at only 4.9%,
is significantly lower than the Latin American and Caribbean
average; poor fixed-line infrastructure has been exacerbated by low
investment and topographical difficulties which have made
investment in rural areas unattractive or uneconomical; the
internet has been slow to develop; DSL and cable modem technologies
are available but are relatively expensive, while higher speed
services are largely restricted to the major urban centers; the
demand for broadband is steadily increasing and there has been some
