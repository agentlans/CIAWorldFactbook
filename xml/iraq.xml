   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Formerly part of the Ottoman Empire, Iraq was occupied by the
United Kingdom during World War I and was declared a League of
Nations mandate under UK administration in 1920. Iraq attained its
independence as a kingdom in 1932. It was proclaimed a "republic"
in 1958 after a coup overthrew the monarchy, but in actuality, a
series of strongmen ruled the country until 2003. The last was
SADDAM Husayn from 1979 to 2003. Territorial disputes with Iran led
to an inconclusive and costly eight-year war (1980-88). In August
1990, Iraq seized Kuwait but was expelled by US-led UN coalition
forces during the Gulf War of January-February 1991. After Iraq's
expulsion, the UN Security Council (UNSC) required Iraq to scrap
all weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles and to
allow UN verification inspections. Continued Iraqi noncompliance
with UNSC resolutions led to the Second Gulf War in March 2003 and
the ouster of the SADDAM Husayn regime by US-led forces.In October 2005, Iraqis approved a constitution in a national
referendum and, pursuant to this document, elected a 275-member
Council of Representatives (COR) in December 2005. The COR approved
most cabinet ministers in May 2006, marking the transition to
Iraq's first constitutional government in nearly a half century.
Iraq held elections for provincial councils in all governorates -
except for Iraq's Kurdistan Region and Kirkuk - in January 2009 and
in April and June 2013, and has repeatedly postponed the next
provincial elections, originally planned for April 2017. Iraq has
held four national legislative elections since 2006, most recently
in October 2021 when 329 legislators were elected to the COR. The
acting Iraqi National Intelligence Service Director General Mustafa
al-KADHIMI became prime minister in May 2020 after the previous
prime minister resigned in late 2019 because of widespread protests
demanding more employment opportunities and an end to corruption.
His mandate as prime minister was to guide Iraq toward an early
national legislative election, which was held in October 2021.Between 2014 and 2017, Iraq was engaged in a military campaign
against the Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS) to recapture
territory lost in the western and northern portion of the country.
Iraqi and allied forces recaptured Mosul, the country's
second-largest city, in 2017 and drove ISIS out of its other urban
strongholds. In December 2017, then-Prime Minister Haydar al-ABADI
publicly declared victory against ISIS while continuing operations
against the group's residual presence in rural areas. Also in late
2017, ABADI responded to an independence referendum held by the
Kurdistan Regional Government by ordering Iraqi forces to take
control of disputed territories across central and northern Iraq
that were previously occupied and governed by Kurdish forces.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Military - note">as of 2022, Iraqi security forces (ISF) continued to conduct
counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations against the
Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS) terrorist group,
particularly in northern and western Iraq; Kurdish Security Forces
(KSF, aka Peshmerga) also conducted operations against
ISIS 

the KSF were formally recognized as a legitimate Iraqi military
force under the country’s constitution and have operated jointly
with the Iraqi military against ISIS militants, but they also
operate outside of Iraqi military command structure; since 2021,
the ISF and the KSF have conducted joint counter-ISIS operations in
an area known as the Kurdish Coordination Line (KCL), a swath of
disputed territory in northern Iraq claimed by both the Kurdistan
Regional Government and the central Iraqi Government; the
KSF/Peshmerga report to the Kurdistan Regional Government or
Kurdistan Democratic Party and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan parties
instead of the Iraqi Ministry of Defense

Popular Mobilization Commission and Affiliated Forces (PMF or PMC),
also known as Popular Mobilization Units (PMU, or al-Hashd
al-Sha’abi in Arabic), tribal militia units have fought alongside
the Iraqi military against ISIS since 2014, but the majority of
these forces continue to largely ignore the 2016 Law of the Popular
Mobilization Authority, which mandated that armed militias must be
regulated in a fashion similar to Iraq’s other security forces and
act under the Iraqi Government’s direct control; the Iraqi
Government funds the PMF, and the prime minister legally commands
it, but many of the militia units take orders from associated
political parties and/or other government officials, including some
with ties to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and some
that have been designated as terrorist organizations by the US; the
PMF/PMU is an umbrella organization comprised of many different
militias, the majority of which are Shia:

--Shia militias backed by Iran; they are considered the most active
and capable, and include such groups as the Badr Organization
(Saraya al-Sala), Asaib Ahl al-Haq, and Kataib Hizballah

--Shia militias affiliated with Shia political parties, but not
aligned with Iran, such as the Peace Brigades (Saray
al-Salam)

--Shia militias not connected with political parties, but
affiliated with the Najaf-based Grand Ayatollah Ali al-SISTANI
(Iraq’s supreme Shia cleric), such as the Hawza militias

--other PMF/PMU militias include Sunni Tribal Mobilization
militias, or Hashd al-Asha’iri; some of these militias take orders
from the ISF and local authorities while others respond to orders
from the larger Shia PMU militias; still other militias include
Yazidi and Christian militias and the Turkmen brigades; the links
of these forces to the PMU is not always clear-cut and may be
loosely based on financial, legal, or political incentives

at the request of the Iraqi government, NATO agreed to establish an
advisory, training and capacity-building mission for the Iraqi
military in October 2018; as of 2022, the NATO Mission Iraq (NMI)
had about 500 troops; in December 2021, the task force that leads
the defeat ISIS mission in Iraq, Combined Joint Task Force –
Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR), transitioned from a combat
role to an advise, assist, and enable role (2022)</subsection>
