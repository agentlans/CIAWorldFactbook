   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Present-day Turkmenistan covers territory that has been at the
crossroads of civilizations for centuries. The area was ruled in
antiquity by various Persian empires, and was conquered by
Alexander the Great, Muslim armies, the Mongols, Turkic warriors,
and eventually the Russians. In medieval times, Merv (located in
present-day Mary province) was one of the great cities of the
Islamic world and an important stop on the Silk Road. Annexed by
Russia in the late 1800s, Turkmen territories later figured
prominently in the anti-Bolshevik resistance in Central Asia. In
1924, Turkmenistan became a Soviet republic; it achieved
independence upon the dissolution of the USSR in 1991. President
for Life Saparmyrat NYYAZOW died in December 2006, and Gurbanguly
BERDIMUHAMEDOW, a deputy chairman under NYYAZOW, emerged as the
country's new president. BERDIMUHAMEDOW won Turkmenistan's first
multi-candidate presidential election in February 2007, and again
in 2012 and in 2017 with over 97% of the vote in both instances, in
elections widely regarded as undemocratic.  In February 2022,
BERDIMUHAMEDOW announced that he would step down from the
presidency and called for an election to replace him. His son,
Serdar BERDIMUHAMEDOW, won the ensuing election, held in March
2022, with 73% of the vote. Gurbanguly BERDIMUHAMEDOW, although no
longer head of state, maintains an influential political position
as head of the Halk Maslahaty (People’s Council).<br/>
         <br/>
Turkmenistan has sought new export markets for its extensive
hydrocarbon/natural gas reserves, which have yet to be fully
exploited. As of late 2021, Turkmenistan exported the majority of
its gas to China and smaller levels of gas to Russia.
Turkmenistan's reliance on gas exports has made the economy
vulnerable to fluctuations in the global energy market, and
economic hardships since the drop in energy prices in 2014 have led
many Turkmenistanis to emigrate, mostly to Turkey. Heavy
restrictions placed by the government in 2020 on entry and exit
into the country in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted
in a steep drop in emigration, however.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">While Turkmenistan reputedly has a population of more than 5.6
million, the figure is most likely considerably less. Getting an
accurate population estimate for the country is impossible because
then President Gurbanguly BERDIMUHAMEDOW withheld the results of
the last two censuses. The 2012 census results reportedly show that
nearly 2 million citizens have emigrated in the last decade, which
prompted BERDIMUHAMEDOW to order another census. Results of this
census, covering 2008-2018, also were not released to the public
but purportedly are similar. Another census was held in December
2022.Authorities have reacted to the dramatic population decline by
preventing Turkmen from leaving the country, including removing
citizens from international flights and refusing to provide
necessary documents. Turkmenistan’s rise in outmigration – mainly
to Turkey, Russia, and Uzbekistan – coincided with the country’s
2013-2014 economic crisis. The outflow has been sustained by poor
living standards, inflation, low income, and a lack of health care.
At the same time, Ashbagat is encouraging people to have more
children to make up for its shrinking population.</subsection>

which rivals only North Korea for its isolationism, continues to
keep its telecom sector along with the broader populace under tight
control; the country inched up just one point off the bottom of the
world rankings for press and internet freedom in the most recent
report from Reporters Without Borders; most social networks in the
country are blocked, although locals do have access to the
government-developed platform released in 2019; all internet users,
however, need to identify themselves before logging on, and strict
censorship over what can be viewed is in force; the end result is
that Turkmenistan has one of the lowest penetration rates for
internet access in the world (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line nearly 12 per 100 and
mobile-cellular teledensity is about 155 per 100 persons; first
telecommunication satellite was launched in 2015 (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 993; linked by
fiber-optic cable and microwave radio relay to other CIS republics
and to other countries by leased connections to the Moscow
international gateway switch; an exchange in Ashgabat switches
international traffic through Turkey via Intelsat; satellite earth
stations - 1 Orbita and 1 Intelsat (2018)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

      <subsection title="Trafficking in persons">tier rating: Tier 3 — Turkmenistan does not
fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking
and is not making significant efforts to do so; the government
approved the 2020-2022 national action plan, continued
anti-trafficking awareness campaigns, worked with international
organizations on combating trafficking, provided training to its
diplomatic corps on human trafficking, and identified potential
trafficking victims at the international airport; however, the
 government used forced labor in the cotton harvest and public
works projects; no officials were held accountable for their role
in trafficking crimes; authorities did not prosecute or convict any
traffickers; no victims were identified and offered protection or
assistance programs (2020)<br/>

trafficking profile: Turkmenistan is a source, and
to a much lesser degree, destination country for men, women, and
children who are subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking;
Turkmen in search of work in other countries are forced to work in
textile sweatshops, construction, and domestic service; some
Turkmen women and girls are sex trafficked abroad; Turkey is the
primary trafficking destination, followed by Russia, India, and
other countries in the Middle East, South and Central Asia, and
Europe; labor trafficking occurs within Turkmenistan, particularly
in the construction industry; government officials require
employees in private sector institutions, soldiers, and public
sector workers to pick cotton without payment under the threat of
penalty, such as dismissal, reduced work hours, or salary
deductions to meet government-imposed quotas for the cotton
harvest</subsection>
