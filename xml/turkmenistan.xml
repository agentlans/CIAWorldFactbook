   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Present-day Turkmenistan covers territory that has been at the
crossroads of civilizations for centuries. The area was ruled in
antiquity by various Persian empires, and was conquered by
Alexander the Great, Muslim armies, the Mongols, Turkic warriors,
and eventually the Russians. In medieval times, Merv (located in
present-day Mary province) was one of the great cities of the
Islamic world and an important stop on the Silk Road. Annexed by
Russia in the late 1800s, Turkmen territories later figured
prominently in the anti-Bolshevik resistance in Central Asia. In
1924, Turkmenistan became a Soviet republic; it achieved
independence upon the dissolution of the USSR in 1991. President
for Life Saparmyrat NYYAZOW died in December 2006, and Gurbanguly
BERDIMUHAMEDOW, a deputy chairman under NYYAZOW, emerged as the
country's new president. BERDIMUHAMEDOW won Turkmenistan's first
multi-candidate presidential election in February 2007, and again
in 2012 and in 2017 with over 97% of the vote in both instances, in
elections widely regarded as undemocratic.  In February 2022,
BERDIMUHAMEDOW announced that he would step down from the
presidency and called for an election to replace him. His son,
Serdar BERDIMUHAMEDOW, won the ensuing election, held in March
2022, with 73% of the vote. Gurbanguly BERDIMUHAMEDOW, although no
longer head of state, maintains an influential political position
as head of the Halk Maslahaty (People’s Council).

Turkmenistan has sought new export markets for its extensive
hydrocarbon/natural gas reserves, which have yet to be fully
exploited. As of late 2021, Turkmenistan exported the majority of
its gas to China and smaller levels of gas to Russia.
Turkmenistan's reliance on gas exports has made the economy
vulnerable to fluctuations in the global energy market, and
economic hardships since the drop in energy prices in 2014 have led
many Turkmenistanis to emigrate, mostly to Turkey. Heavy
restrictions placed by the government in 2020 on entry and exit
into the country in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted
in a steep drop in emigration, however.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">While Turkmenistan reputedly has a population of more than 5.6
million, the figure is most likely considerably less. Getting an
accurate population estimate for the country is impossible because
then President Gurbanguly BERDIMUHAMEDOW withheld the results of
the last two censuses. The 2012 census results reportedly show that
nearly 2 million citizens have emigrated in the last decade, which
prompted BERDIMUHAMEDOW to order another census. Results of this
census, covering 2008-2018, also were not released to the public
but purportedly are similar. Another census was held in December
2022.Authorities have reacted to the dramatic population decline by
preventing Turkmen from leaving the country, including removing
citizens from international flights and refusing to provide
necessary documents. Turkmenistan’s rise in outmigration – mainly
to Turkey, Russia, and Uzbekistan – coincided with the country’s
2013-2014 economic crisis. The outflow has been sustained by poor
living standards, inflation, low income, and a lack of health care.
At the same time, Ashbagat is encouraging people to have more
children to make up for its shrinking population.</subsection>
