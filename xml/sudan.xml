   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Long referred to as Nubia, modern-day Sudan was the site of the
Kingdom of Kerma (ca. 2500-1500 B.C.) until it was absorbed into
the New Kingdom of Egypt. By the 11th century B.C., the Kingdom of
Kush gained independence from Egypt; it lasted in various forms
until the middle of the 4th century A.D. After the fall of Kush,
the Nubians formed three Christian kingdoms of Nobatia, Makuria,
and Alodia. The latter two endured until around 1500. Between the
14th and 15th centuries much of Sudan was settled by Arab nomads,
and between the 16th–19th centuries it underwent extensive
Islamization. Following Egyptian occupation early in the 19th
century, the British established an Anglo-Egyptian Sudan -
nominally a condominium, but in effect a British colony.

Military regimes favoring Islamic-oriented governments have
dominated national politics since Sudan gained independence from
Anglo-Egyptian co-rule in 1956. The 30-year reign of President Omar
Hassan Ahmad al-BASHIR, following months of nationwide protests,
ended with the military forcing him out in April 2019. In July
2019, the country’s Transitional Military Council signed an
agreement with the Forces for Freedom and Change (an umbrella group
of civilian actors) to form a transitional government under a
Constitutional Declaration. Economist and former international
civil servant Abdalla HAMDOUK al-Kinani was selected to serve as
prime minister of a civilian-led transitional government, which was
to have guided the country to credible democratic elections in late
2022. In October 2021, the Sudanese military organized a takeover
that ousted Prime Minister HAMDOUK and his government and replaced
civilian members of the Sovereign Council (Sudan’s collective Head
of State) with individuals selected by the military. HAMDOUK was
briefly reinstated in November 2021 but resigned in January
2022.As of March 2022, General Abd-al-Fatah al-BURHAN Abd-al-Rahman,
the Chair of Sudan’s Sovereign Council and Commander-in-Chief of
the Sudanese Armed Forces, serves as de facto head of state and
government. He presides over a Sovereign Council consisting of
military leaders, former armed opposition group representatives,
and civilians appointed by the military. A cabinet of acting
ministers handles day-to-day administration. These acting ministers
are either senior civil servants (some appointed by former Prime
Minister HAMDOUK and some selected by the military) or holdover
ministers from Prime Minister HAMDOUK’s former cabinet who were
appointed by former armed opposition groups that the military
allowed to remain in their positions. The UN, the African Union,
and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development are currently
facilitating a Sudanese-led political process intended to enable
Sudanese civilian and military stakeholders to agree on the
framework for a new civilian-led transitional government.

During most of the second half of the 20th century, Sudan was
embroiled in two prolonged civil wars rooted in northern economic,
political, and social domination of the largely non-Muslim,
non-Arab southern portion of the country. The first civil war ended
in 1972, but another broke out in 1983. Peace talks gained momentum
in 2002-04, and the final North/South Comprehensive Peace Agreement
(CPA), signed in January 2005, granted the southern rebels autonomy
for six years followed by a referendum on independence for Southern
Sudan. South Sudan became independent on 9 July 2011, but Sudan and
South Sudan have yet to fully implement security and economic
agreements relating to the normalization of relations between the
two countries.

In the 21st century, Sudan faced conflict in Darfur, Southern
Kordofan, and Blue Nile starting in 2003. Together, these conflicts
displaced more than 3 million people; while some repatriation has
taken place, about 3.04 million IDPs remained in Sudan as of
February 2022. Sudan also faces refugee influxes from neighboring
countries, primarily Central African Republic, Eritrea, Ethiopia,
South Sudan, and Syria. </subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Sudan’s population grew almost fourfold between 1956 and 2008,
the date of its last census.  Even after the southern part of
the country became independent South Sudan in 2011, the population
of Sudan has continued to grow.  The gender balance overall is
fairly even.  Females, however, are more prevalent in rural
areas because of males migrating to urban areas in search of
work.  The total fertility rate (TFR) remains high despite
falling from 7 children per woman in Sudan’s first census in 1955
to about 4.5 in 2022, which can be attributed to early marriage and
a low contraceptive prevalence rate.  Among the factors that
led to the reduction in fertility are family planning, improvement
in women’s education and participation in the labor force outside
the home, and migration and urbanization. The continued slow decline in fertility accompanied by a drop in
mortality and increased life expectancy has produced an age
structure where approximately 55% of the population was of working
age (15-64) as of 2020.  This share will grow as the sizable
youth population becomes working age.  As Sudan’s working age
population increasingly outnumbers the youth and elderly
populations (the dependent populations), the country will approach
the possibility of a demographic dividend.  The window of
opportunity for potential economic growth depends not only on a
favorable age structure but also on having a trained and educated
workforce, job creation (particularly in the formal market), and
investment in health, as well as generating savings to invest in
schooling and care for the elderly.  As of 2018, Sudan’s
literacy rate was just over 60%, and even lower among women. 
Improvements in school enrollment, student-teacher ratio,
infrastructure, funding, and educational quality could help the
country to realize a demographic dividend.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">Sudan emerged as a poorer country when South Sudan separated from it in 2011; although Sudan has about four times the population of South Sudan, the latter benefits from its control of the majority of known oil reserves; the Sudanese economy has been affected by hyperinflation in recent years, partly the result of the loss of oil revenue but also due to domestic volatility and social unrest; the difficult economic conditions have meant that for several years telcos have reported revenue under hyper inflationary reporting standards; pressure on revenue has made it difficult for operators to invest in infrastructure upgrades, and so provide improved services to customers; despite this, the number of mobile subscribers increased 7.% in 20201, year-on-year; this level of growth is expected to have been maintained in 2022, though could slow from 2023 as the acute influences resulting the pandemic begin to wane; the country’s poor fixed-line infrastructure has helped the development of mobile broadband services (2022)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>

      <subsection title="Broadcast media">Following the establishment of Sudan’s civilian-led transitional
government in August 2019, government-owned broadcasters became
increasingly independent from government and military control.
Following the October 2021 military takeover, additional
restrictions were imposed on these government-owned broadcasters,
which now practice a heightened degree of self-censorship but still
operate more independently than in the pre-2019 environment.

traffic police, Central Reserve Police (2022)
<note title="note 1">the RSF is a semi-autonomous paramilitary force formed in 2013 to fight armed rebel groups in Sudan, with Mohammed Hamdan DAGALO (aka Hemeti) as its commander (he is also a member of the Sovereign Council); it was initially placed under the National Intelligence and Security Service, then came under the direct command of former president Omar al-BASHIR, who boosted the RSF as his own personal security force; as a result, the RSF was better funded and equipped than the regular armed forces; the RSF has since recruited from all parts of Sudan beyond its original Darfuri Arab groups but remains under the personal patronage and control of DAGALO; the RSF has been accused of committing human rights abuses against civilians; it is also reportedly involved in business enterprises, such as gold mining; in late 2019, Sovereign Council Chairman and SAF Commander-in-Chief General Abd-al-Fatah al-BURHAN said the RSF would be fully integrated into the SAF, but did not give a timeline</note>
