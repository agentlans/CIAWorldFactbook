   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Long referred to as Nubia, modern-day Sudan was the site of the
Kingdom of Kerma (ca. 2500-1500 B.C.) until it was absorbed into
the New Kingdom of Egypt. By the 11th century B.C., the Kingdom of
Kush gained independence from Egypt; it lasted in various forms
until the middle of the 4th century A.D. After the fall of Kush,
the Nubians formed three Christian kingdoms of Nobatia, Makuria,
and Alodia. The latter two endured until around 1500. Between the
14th and 15th centuries much of Sudan was settled by Arab nomads,
and between the 16th–19th centuries it underwent extensive
Islamization. Following Egyptian occupation early in the 19th
century, the British established an Anglo-Egyptian Sudan -
nominally a condominium, but in effect a British colony.<br/>
         <br/>
Military regimes favoring Islamic-oriented governments have
dominated national politics since Sudan gained independence from
Anglo-Egyptian co-rule in 1956. The 30-year reign of President Omar
Hassan Ahmad al-BASHIR, following months of nationwide protests,
ended with the military forcing him out in April 2019. In July
2019, the country’s Transitional Military Council signed an
agreement with the Forces for Freedom and Change (an umbrella group
of civilian actors) to form a transitional government under a
Constitutional Declaration. Economist and former international
civil servant Abdalla HAMDOUK al-Kinani was selected to serve as
prime minister of a civilian-led transitional government, which was
to have guided the country to credible democratic elections in late
2022. In October 2021, the Sudanese military organized a takeover
that ousted Prime Minister HAMDOUK and his government and replaced
civilian members of the Sovereign Council (Sudan’s collective Head
of State) with individuals selected by the military. HAMDOUK was
briefly reinstated in November 2021 but resigned in January
2022.As of March 2022, General Abd-al-Fatah al-BURHAN Abd-al-Rahman,
the Chair of Sudan’s Sovereign Council and Commander-in-Chief of
the Sudanese Armed Forces, serves as de facto head of state and
government. He presides over a Sovereign Council consisting of
military leaders, former armed opposition group representatives,
and civilians appointed by the military. A cabinet of acting
ministers handles day-to-day administration. These acting ministers
are either senior civil servants (some appointed by former Prime
Minister HAMDOUK and some selected by the military) or holdover
ministers from Prime Minister HAMDOUK’s former cabinet who were
appointed by former armed opposition groups that the military
allowed to remain in their positions. The UN, the African Union,
and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development are currently
facilitating a Sudanese-led political process intended to enable
Sudanese civilian and military stakeholders to agree on the
framework for a new civilian-led transitional government.<br/>
         <br/>
During most of the second half of the 20th century, Sudan was
embroiled in two prolonged civil wars rooted in northern economic,
political, and social domination of the largely non-Muslim,
non-Arab southern portion of the country. The first civil war ended
in 1972, but another broke out in 1983. Peace talks gained momentum
in 2002-04, and the final North/South Comprehensive Peace Agreement
(CPA), signed in January 2005, granted the southern rebels autonomy
for six years followed by a referendum on independence for Southern
Sudan. South Sudan became independent on 9 July 2011, but Sudan and
South Sudan have yet to fully implement security and economic
agreements relating to the normalization of relations between the
two countries.<br/>
         <br/>
In the 21st century, Sudan faced conflict in Darfur, Southern
Kordofan, and Blue Nile starting in 2003. Together, these conflicts
displaced more than 3 million people; while some repatriation has
taken place, about 3.04 million IDPs remained in Sudan as of
February 2022. Sudan also faces refugee influxes from neighboring
countries, primarily Central African Republic, Eritrea, Ethiopia,
South Sudan, and Syria. </subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Sudan’s population grew almost fourfold between 1956 and 2008,
the date of its last census.  Even after the southern part of
the country became independent South Sudan in 2011, the population
of Sudan has continued to grow.  The gender balance overall is
fairly even.  Females, however, are more prevalent in rural
areas because of males migrating to urban areas in search of
work.  The total fertility rate (TFR) remains high despite
falling from 7 children per woman in Sudan’s first census in 1955
to about 4.5 in 2022, which can be attributed to early marriage and
a low contraceptive prevalence rate.  Among the factors that
led to the reduction in fertility are family planning, improvement
in women’s education and participation in the labor force outside
the home, and migration and urbanization. The continued slow decline in fertility accompanied by a drop in
mortality and increased life expectancy has produced an age
structure where approximately 55% of the population was of working
age (15-64) as of 2020.  This share will grow as the sizable
youth population becomes working age.  As Sudan’s working age
population increasingly outnumbers the youth and elderly
populations (the dependent populations), the country will approach
the possibility of a demographic dividend.  The window of
opportunity for potential economic growth depends not only on a
favorable age structure but also on having a trained and educated
workforce, job creation (particularly in the formal market), and
investment in health, as well as generating savings to invest in
schooling and care for the elderly.  As of 2018, Sudan’s
literacy rate was just over 60%, and even lower among women. 
Improvements in school enrollment, student-teacher ratio,
infrastructure, funding, and educational quality could help the
country to realize a demographic dividend.</subsection>

Commander-in-Chief of the Sudanese Armed Forces General
Abd-al-Fatah al-BURHAN Abd-al-Rahman; note – the 2019
Constitutional Declaration established a collective chief of state
of the "Sovereign Council," which was chaired by al-BURHAN; on 25
October 2021, al-BURHAN dissolved the Sovereign Council but
reinstated it on 11 November 2021, replacing its civilian members
(previously selected by the umbrella civilian coalition the Forces
for Freedom and Change) with civilians of the military’s choosing;
the Sovereign Council currently consists of 5 military-appointed
civilians, 5 generals, and 3 representatives selected by former
armed opposition groups<br/>
         <br/>
head of government: Sovereign Council Chair and
Commander-in-Chief of the Sudanese Armed Forces General
Abd-al-Fatah al-BURHAN Abd-al-Rahman; Acting Prime Minister Osman
HUSSEIN (since 19 January 2022); note - former Prime Minister
Abdallah HAMDOUK resigned on 2 January 2022; HAMDOUK served as
prime minister from August 2019 to October 2019 before he was
kidnapped; he was later freed and reinstated as prime minister on
21 November 2021<br/>
         <br/>
cabinet: most members of the Council of Ministers
were forced from office in October 2021 by the military and
subsequently resigned in November 2021; the military allowed a
handful of ministers appointed by former armed opposition groups to
retain their posts; at present, most of the members of the Council
are senior civil servants serving in an acting minister capacity
appointed either by Prime Minister HAMDOUK prior to his resignation
or by the military<br/>
         <br/>
elections/appointments: the 2019 Constitutional
Declaration originally called for elections to be held in late 2022
at the end of the transitional period; that date was pushed back to
late 2023 by the Juba Peace Agreement; the methodology for future
elections has not yet been defined; according to the 2019
Constitutional Declaration, civilian members of the Sovereign
Council and the prime minister were to have been nominated by an
umbrella coalition of civilian actors known as the Forces for
Freedom and Change; this methodology was followed in selecting
HAMDOUK as prime minister in August 2019; the military purports to
have suspended this provision of the 2019 Constitutional
Declaration in October 2021; Prime Minister HAMDOUK’s restoration
to office in November 2021 was the result of an agreement signed
between him and Sovereign Council Chair BURHAN; military members of
the Sovereign Council are selected by the leadership of the
security forces; representatives of former armed groups to the
Sovereign Council are selected by the signatories of the Juba Peace

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Sudan emerged as a poorer
country when South Sudan separated from it in 2011; although Sudan
has about four times the population of South Sudan, the latter
benefits from its control of the majority of known oil reserves;
the Sudanese economy has been affected by hyperinflation in recent
years, partly the result of the loss of oil revenue but also due to
domestic volatility and social unrest; the difficult economic
conditions have meant that for several years telcos have reported
revenue under hyper inflationary reporting standards; pressure on
revenue has made it difficult for operators to invest in
infrastructure upgrades, and so provide improved services to
customers; despite this, the number of mobile subscribers increased
7.% in 20201, year-on-year; this level of growth is expected to
have been maintained in 2022, though could slow from 2023 as the
acute influences resulting the pandemic begin to wane; the
country’s poor fixed-line infrastructure has helped the development
of mobile broadband services (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: consists of microwave radio relay,
cable, fiber optic, radiotelephone communications, tropospheric
scatter, and a domestic satellite system with 14 earth stations;
teledensity fixed-line less than 1 per 100 and mobile-cellular over
80 telephones per 100 persons (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 249; landing points
for the EASSy, FALCON and SAS-1,-2, fiber-optic submarine
cable systems linking Africa, the Middle East, Indian Ocean Islands
and Asia; satellite earth stations - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean)
(2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased

      <subsection title="Broadcast media">Following the establishment of Sudan’s civilian-led transitional
government in August 2019, government-owned broadcasters became
increasingly independent from government and military control.
Following the October 2021 military takeover, additional
restrictions were imposed on these government-owned broadcasters,
which now practice a heightened degree of self-censorship but still
operate more independently than in the pre-2019 environment.

note 1: the RSF is a semi-autonomous paramilitary
force formed in 2013 to fight armed rebel groups in Sudan, with
Mohammed Hamdan DAGALO (aka Hemeti) as its commander (he is also a
member of the Sovereign Council); it was initially placed under the
National Intelligence and Security Service, then came under the
direct command of former president Omar al-BASHIR, who boosted the
RSF as his own personal security force; as a result, the RSF was
better funded and equipped than the regular armed forces; the RSF
has since recruited from all parts of Sudan beyond its original
Darfuri Arab groups but remains under the personal patronage and
control of DAGALO; the RSF has been accused of committing human
rights abuses against civilians; it is also reportedly involved in
business enterprises, such as gold mining; in late 2019, Sovereign
Council Chairman and SAF Commander-in-Chief General Abd-al-Fatah
al-BURHAN said the RSF would be fully integrated into the SAF, but
did not give a timeline<br/>
