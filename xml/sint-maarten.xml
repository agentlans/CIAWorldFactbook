   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Although sighted by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1493 and claimed for
Spain, it was the Dutch who occupied the island in 1631 and began
exploiting its salt deposits. The Spanish retook the island in
1633, but the Dutch continued to assert their claims. The Spanish
finally relinquished the island of Saint Martin to the French and
Dutch, who divided it between themselves in 1648. The establishment
of cotton, tobacco, and sugar plantations dramatically expanded
African slavery on the island in the 18th and 19th centuries; the
practice was not abolished in the Dutch half until 1863. The
island's economy declined until 1939 when it became a free port;
the tourism industry was dramatically expanded beginning in the
1950s. In 1954, Sint Maarten and several other Dutch Caribbean
possessions became part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands as the
Netherlands Antilles. In a 2000 referendum, the citizens of Sint
Maarten voted to become a self-governing country within the Kingdom
of the Netherlands, effective October 2010. On 6 September 2017,
Hurricane Irma hit Saint Martin/Sint Maarten, causing extensive
damage to roads, communications, electrical power, and housing. The
UN estimated the storm destroyed or damaged 90% of the buildings,
and Princess Juliana International Airport was heavily damaged and
closed to commercial air traffic for five weeks.</subsection>
