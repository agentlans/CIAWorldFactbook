   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The native Taino - who inhabited the island of Hispaniola when
Christopher COLUMBUS first landed on it in 1492 - were virtually
wiped out by Spanish settlers within 25 years. In the early 17th
century, the French established a presence on Hispaniola. In 1697,
Spain ceded to the French the western third of the island, which
later became Haiti. The French colony, based on forestry and
sugar-related industries, became one of the wealthiest in the
Caribbean but relied heavily on the forced labor of enslaved
Africans and environmentally degrading practices. In the late 18th
century, Toussaint L'OUVERTURE led a revolution of Haiti's nearly
half a million slaves that ended France's rule on the island. After
a prolonged struggle, and under the leadership of Jean-Jacques
DESSALINES, Haiti became the first country in the world led by
former slaves after declaring its independence in 1804, but it was
forced to pay an indemnity of 100 million francs (equivalent to $21
billion USD in March 2022) to France for more than a century and
was shunned by other countries for nearly 40 years. On 12 July
1862, the US officially recognized Haiti, but foreign economic
influence and internal political instability induced the US to
occupy Haiti from 1915-1934. Subsequently, Francois "Papa Doc"
DUVALIER and then his son Jean-Claude "Baby Doc" DUVALIER led
repressive and corrupt regimes that ruled Haiti in 1957-1971 and
1971-1986, respectively. President Jovenel MOISE was assassinated
on 7 July 2021, leading the country further into an
extra-constitutional governance structure and contributing to the
country’s growing fragility. President MOISE's five-year term would
have ended on 7 February 2022; his assassination plunged Haiti
deeper into a political crisis that was not anticipated in its
constitution. Thus, on 20 July 2021, the Government of Haiti
installed Ariel HENRY - whom President MOISE had nominated - as
prime minister. As of March 2022, Haiti had no president, no
parliamentary quorum, and a dysfunctional high court due to a lack
of judges. Haiti has long been plagued by natural disasters. In
January 2010, a major 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck Haiti with an
epicenter about 25 km (15 mi) west of the capital, Port-au-Prince.
Estimates are that over 300,000 people were killed and some 1.5
million left homeless. The earthquake was assessed as the worst in
this region over the last 200 years. A 7.2 magnitude earthquake hit
Haiti’s southern peninsula in August 2021, causing well over 2,000
deaths; an estimated 500,000 required emergency humanitarian aid.
Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, as well as
one of the most unequal in wealth distribution.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Haiti is in desperate need
of maintaining effective communication services to enable it to
keep going through the countless natural disasters, the country’s
telecoms sector is really only surviving on the back of
international goodwill to repair and replace the systems destroyed
in the latest upheaval; Haiti’s fixed-line infrastructure is now
practically non-existent, having been torn apart by Hurricane
Matthew in 2016; what aid and additional investment has been
forthcoming has been directed towards mobile solutions; over half
of the country can afford a mobile handset or the cost of a monthly
subscription; and mobile broadband subscriptions is half of that
again – an estimated 28% in 2022; international aid continues to
flow in to try and help the country’s telecoms sector recover – the
World Bank has released a further $120 million to go on top of the
$60 million grant provided after the last major 7.2 earthquake in
August 2021 (2022)<br/>
         <br/>

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

CONATEL (Conseil National des Télécommunications), there are 398

the FM band in Haiti is oversaturated by 158 percent; most radio
stations broadcast 17 to 19 hours a day; there are 105 television
stations operating in Haiti, including 36 TV stations in Port- au-
Prince, 41 others in the provinces, and more than 40

operate irregularly and some stations operate with technical
