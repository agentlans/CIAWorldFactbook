   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The native Taino - who inhabited the island of Hispaniola when
Christopher COLUMBUS first landed on it in 1492 - were virtually
wiped out by Spanish settlers within 25 years. In the early 17th
century, the French established a presence on Hispaniola. In 1697,
Spain ceded to the French the western third of the island, which
later became Haiti. The French colony, based on forestry and
sugar-related industries, became one of the wealthiest in the
Caribbean but relied heavily on the forced labor of enslaved
Africans and environmentally degrading practices. In the late 18th
century, Toussaint L'OUVERTURE led a revolution of Haiti's nearly
half a million slaves that ended France's rule on the island. After
a prolonged struggle, and under the leadership of Jean-Jacques
DESSALINES, Haiti became the first country in the world led by
former slaves after declaring its independence in 1804, but it was
forced to pay an indemnity of 100 million francs (equivalent to $21
billion USD in March 2022) to France for more than a century and
was shunned by other countries for nearly 40 years. On 12 July
1862, the US officially recognized Haiti, but foreign economic
influence and internal political instability induced the US to
occupy Haiti from 1915-1934. Subsequently, Francois "Papa Doc"
DUVALIER and then his son Jean-Claude "Baby Doc" DUVALIER led
repressive and corrupt regimes that ruled Haiti in 1957-1971 and
1971-1986, respectively. President Jovenel MOISE was assassinated
on 7 July 2021, leading the country further into an
extra-constitutional governance structure and contributing to the
country’s growing fragility. President MOISE's five-year term would
have ended on 7 February 2022; his assassination plunged Haiti
deeper into a political crisis that was not anticipated in its
constitution. Thus, on 20 July 2021, the Government of Haiti
installed Ariel HENRY - whom President MOISE had nominated - as
prime minister. As of March 2022, Haiti had no president, no
parliamentary quorum, and a dysfunctional high court due to a lack
of judges. Haiti has long been plagued by natural disasters. In
January 2010, a major 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck Haiti with an
epicenter about 25 km (15 mi) west of the capital, Port-au-Prince.
Estimates are that over 300,000 people were killed and some 1.5
million left homeless. The earthquake was assessed as the worst in
this region over the last 200 years. A 7.2 magnitude earthquake hit
Haiti’s southern peninsula in August 2021, causing well over 2,000
deaths; an estimated 500,000 required emergency humanitarian aid.
Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, as well as
one of the most unequal in wealth distribution.</subsection>
