   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The archipelago of the Comoros in the Indian Ocean, composed of
the islands of Anjouan, Mayotte, Moheli, and Grande Comore,
declared independence from France on 6 July 1975. Residents of
Mayotte, however, voted to remain in France, and the French
Government now has classified it as a department of France. Since
independence, Comoros has endured political instability through
realized and attempted coups. In 1997, the islands of Anjouan and
Moheli declared independence from Comoros. In 1999, military chief
Col. AZALI Assoumani seized power of the entire government in a
bloodless coup; he initiated the 2000 Fomboni Accords, a
power-sharing agreement in which the federal presidency rotates
among the three islands, and each island maintains its local
government. AZALI won the 2002 federal presidential election as
president of the Union of the Comoros from Grande Comore Island,
which held the first four-year term. AZALI stepped down in 2006 and
President Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed SAMBI was elected as president
from Anjouan. In 2007, Mohamed BACAR effected Anjouan's de-facto
secession from the Union of the Comoros, refusing to step down when
Comoros' other islands held legitimate elections in July. The
African Union (AU) initially attempted to resolve the political
crisis by applying sanctions and a naval blockade to Anjouan, but
in March 2008 the AU and Comoran soldiers seized the island. The
island's inhabitants generally welcomed the move. In 2009, the
Comorian population approved a constitutional referendum extending
the term of the president from four years to five years. In May
2011, Ikililou DHOININE won the presidency in peaceful elections
widely deemed to be free and fair. In closely contested elections
in 2016, former President AZALI Assoumani won a second term, when
the rotating presidency returned to Grande Comore. A referendum
held in July 2018 - boycotted by the opposition parties -
overwhelmingly approved a new constitution removing presidential
term limits and the requirement for the presidency to rotate
between the three main islands. In August 2018, President AZALI
formed a new government and subsequently ran and was elected
president in March 2019.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Comoros’ population is a melange of Arabs, Persians,
Indonesians, Africans, and Indians, and the much smaller number of
Europeans that settled on the islands between the 8th and 19th
centuries, when they served as a regional trade hub. The Arab and
Persian influence is most evident in the islands’ overwhelmingly
Muslim majority – about 98% of Comorans are Sunni Muslims. The
country is densely populated, averaging nearly 350 people per
square mile, although this varies widely among the islands, with
Anjouan being the most densely populated.Given the large share of land dedicated to agriculture and
Comoros’ growing population, habitable land is becoming
increasingly crowded. The combination of increasing population
pressure on limited land and resources, widespread poverty, and
poor job prospects motivates thousands of Comorans each year to
attempt to illegally migrate using small fishing boats to the
neighboring island of Mayotte, which is a French territory. The
majority of legal Comoran migration to France came after Comoros’
independence from France in 1975, with the flow peaking in the
mid-1980s.At least 150,000 to 200,000 people of Comoran citizenship or
descent live abroad, mainly in France, where they have gone seeking
a better quality of life, job opportunities, higher education
(Comoros has no universities), advanced health care, and to finance
elaborate traditional wedding ceremonies (aada). Remittances from
the diaspora are an economic mainstay, in 2013 representing
approximately 25% of Comoros’ GDP and significantly more than the
value of its exports of goods and services (only 15% of GDP). Grand
Comore, Comoros’ most populous island, is both the primary source
of emigrants and the main recipient of remittances. Most
remittances are spent on private consumption, but this often goes
toward luxury goods and the aada and does not contribute to
economic development or poverty reduction. Although the majority of
the diaspora is now French-born with more distant ties to Comoros,
it is unclear whether they will sustain the current level of
remittances.</subsection>
