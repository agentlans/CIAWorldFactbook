   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Rwanda - a small and centralized country dominated by rugged
hills and fertile volcanic soil - has exerted disproportionate
influence over the African Great Lakes region for centuries. A
Rwandan kingdom increasingly dominated the region from the mid-18th
century onward, with the Tutsi monarchs gradually extending the
power of the royal court into peripheral areas and expanding their
borders through military conquest. While the current ethnic labels
Hutu and Tutsi predate colonial rule, their flexibility and
importance have varied significantly over time. The majority Hutu
and minority Tutsi have long shared a common language and culture,
and intermarriage was not rare. The Rwandan royal court centered on
the Tutsi king (mwami), who relied on an extensive
hierarchy of political, cultural, and economic relationships that
intertwined Rwanda’s ethnic and social groups. Social categories
became more rigid during the reign of RWABUGIRI (1860-1895), who
focused on aggressive expansion and solidifying Rwanda’s
bureaucratic structures. German colonial rule began in 1898, but
Belgian forces captured Rwanda in 1916 during World War I. Both
European nations quickly realized the benefits of ruling through
the already centralized Rwandan kingdom. Colonial rule reinforced
existing trends toward autocratic and exclusionary rule, leading to
the elimination of traditional positions of authority for Hutus and
a calcification of ethnic identities. Belgian administrators
significantly increased requirements for communal labor and
instituted harsh taxes, increasing frustration and inequality.
Changing political attitudes in Belgium contributed to colonial and
Catholic officials shifting their support from Tutsi to Hutu
leaders in the years leading up to independence.Newly mobilized political parties and simmering resentment of
minority rule exploded in 1959, three years before independence
from Belgium, when Hutus overthrew the Tutsi king. Thousands of
Tutsis were killed over the next several years, and some 150,000
were driven into exile in neighboring countries. Army Chief of
Staff Juvenal HABYARIMANA seized power in a coup in 1973 and ruled
Rwanda as a single-party state for two decades. HABYARIMANA
increasingly discriminated against Tutsi and extremist Hutu
factions that gained prominence after multiple parties were
introduced in the early 1990s. The children of Tutsi exiles later
formed a rebel group, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and began a
civil war in 1990. The civil war exacerbated ethnic tensions and
culminated in the shooting down of HABYARIMANA’s private jet in
April 1994. The event sparked a state-orchestrated genocide in
which Rwandans killed approximately 800,000 of their fellow
citizens, including approximately three-quarters of the Tutsi
population. The genocide ended later that same year when the
predominantly Tutsi RPF, operating out of Uganda and northern
Rwanda, defeated the national army and Hutu militias and
established an RPF-led government of national unity. Rwanda held
its first local elections in 1999 and its first post-genocide
presidential and legislative elections in 2003, formalizing
President Paul KAGAME’s de facto role as head of government. KAGAME
won reelection in 2010, and again in 2017 after changing the
constitution to allow him to run for a third term.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Rwanda’s fertility rate declined sharply during the last decade,
as a result of the government’s commitment to family planning, the
increased use of contraceptives, and a downward trend in ideal
family size. Increases in educational attainment, particularly
among girls, and exposure to social media also contributed to the
reduction in the birth rate. The average number of births per woman
decreased from a 5.6 in 2005 to 4.5 in 2016 and 3.3 in 2022.
Despite these significant strides in reducing fertility, Rwanda’s
birth rate remains very high and will continue to for an extended
period of time because of its large population entering
reproductive age. Because Rwanda is one of the most densely
populated countries in Africa, its persistent high population
growth and increasingly small agricultural landholdings will put
additional strain on families’ ability to raise foodstuffs and
access potable water. These conditions will also hinder the
government’s efforts to reduce poverty and prevent environmental
degradation.The UNHCR recommended that effective 30 June 2013 countries
invoke a cessation of refugee status for those Rwandans who fled
their homeland between 1959 and 1998, including the 1994 genocide,
on the grounds that the conditions that drove them to seek
protection abroad no longer exist. The UNHCR’s decision is
controversial because many Rwandan refugees still fear persecution
if they return home, concerns that are supported by the number of
Rwandans granted asylum since 1998 and by the number exempted from
the cessation. Rwandan refugees can still seek an exemption or
local integration, but host countries are anxious to send the
refugees back to Rwanda and are likely to avoid options that enable
them to stay. Conversely, Rwanda itself hosts approximately 125,000
refugees as of 2022; virtually all of them fleeing conflict in
neighboring Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Rwanda was slow to
liberalize the mobile sector; there was effective competition among
three operators; the fixed broadband sector has suffered from
limited fixed-line infrastructure and high prices; operators are
rolling out national backbone networks which also allow them to
connect to the international submarine cables on Africa’s east
coast; these cables gave the entire region greater internet
bandwidth and ended the dependency on satellites; while the country
also has a new cable link with Tanzania, and via Tanzania’s
national broadband backbone it has gained connectivity to the
networks of several other countries in the region; the number of
subscribers on LTE infrastructure has increased sharply, helped by
national LTE coverage achieved in mid-2018; mobile remains the
dominant platform for voice and data services; the regulator noted
that the number of mobile subscribers increased 2.7% in 2021,
year-on-year; there was a slight fall in the beginning of 2022
(2022)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: the capital, Kigali, is connected to
provincial centers by microwave radio relay, and recently by
cellular telephone service; much of the network depends on wire and
HF radiotelephone; fixed-line less than 1 per 100 and
mobile-cellular telephone density has increased to nearly 82
telephones per 100 persons (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 250; international
connections employ microwave radio relay to neighboring countries
and satellite communications to more distant countries; satellite
earth stations - 1 Intelsat (Indian Ocean) in Kigali (includes
telex and telefax service); international submarine fiber-optic
cables on the African east coast has brought international
bandwidth and lessened the dependency on satellites<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

      <subsection title="Military - note">since 2021, Rwanda has deployed troops to the border with the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to combat the rebel
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR); it has also
been accused by the DRC Government of providing material support to
the March 23 Movement (M23, aka Congolese Revolutionary Army) rebel
group, which as of 2022 was fighting with DRC troops and UN
peacekeeping forces<br/>
         <br/>
the Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR) were established following
independence in 1962; after the 1990-1994 civil war and genocide,
the victorious Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front's military
wing, the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA), became the country's
military force; the RPA participated in the First (1996-1997) and
Second (1998-2003) Congolese Wars; the RPA was renamed the Rwanda
Defense Force (RDF) in 2003, by which time it had assumed a more
national character with the inclusion of many former Hutu officers
as well as newly recruited soldiers<br/>
         <br/>
the RDF is widely regarded as one of Africa’s best trained and most
capable and professional military forces; as of 2022, over 7,000
RDF and police personnel were deployed on missions in Africa
