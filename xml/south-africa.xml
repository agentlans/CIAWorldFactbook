   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Some of the earliest human remains in the fossil record are
found in South Africa. By about A.D. 500, Bantu speaking groups
began settling into what is now northeastern South Africa
displacing Khoisan speaking groups to the southwest. Dutch traders
landed at the southern tip of present-day South Africa in 1652 and
established a stopover point on the spice route between the
Netherlands and the Far East, founding the city of Cape Town. After
the British seized the Cape of Good Hope area in 1806, many of the
settlers of Dutch descent (Afrikaners, also called "Boers"
(farmers) at the time) trekked north to found their own republics,
Transvaal and Orange Free State. In the 1820s, several decades of
wars began as the Zulus expanded their territory, moving out of
what is today southeastern South Africa and clashing with other
indigenous peoples and with expanding European settlements. The
discovery of diamonds (1867) and gold (1886) spurred wealth and
immigration from Europe.

The Anglo-Zulu War (1879) resulted in the incorporation of the Zulu
kingdom's territory into the British Empire. Subsequently, the
Afrikaner republics were incorporated into the British Empire after
their defeat in the Second South African War (1899-1902). However,
the British and the Afrikaners ruled together beginning in 1910
under the Union of South Africa, which became a republic in 1961
after a Whites-only referendum. In 1948, the National Party was
voted into power and instituted a policy of apartheid – billed as
"separate development" of the races - which favored the White
minority at the expense of the Black majority and other non-White
groups. The African National Congress (ANC) led the opposition to
apartheid and many top ANC leaders, such as Nelson MANDELA, spent
decades in South Africa's prisons. Internal protests and
insurgency, as well as boycotts by some Western nations and
institutions, led to the regime's eventual willingness to negotiate
a peaceful transition to majority rule.The first multi-racial elections in 1994 following the end of
apartheid ushered in majority rule under an ANC-led government.
South Africa has since struggled to address apartheid-era
imbalances in wealth, housing, education, and health care. Jacob
ZUMA became president in 2009 and was reelected in 2014, but
resigned in February 2018 after numerous corruption scandals and
gains by opposition parties in municipal elections in 2016. His
successor, Cyril RAMAPHOSA, has made some progress in reigning in
corruption, though many challenges persist. In May 2019 national
elections, the country’s sixth since the end of apartheid, the ANC
won a majority of parliamentary seats, delivering RAMAPHOSA a
five-year term.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">South Africa’s youthful population is gradually aging, as the
country’s total fertility rate (TFR) has declined dramatically from
about 6 children per woman in the 1960s to roughly 2.2 in 2014, and
has remained at this level as of 2022. This pattern is similar to
fertility trends in South Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa,
and sets South Africa apart from the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa,
where the average TFR remains higher than other regions of the
world. Today, South Africa’s decreasing number of reproductive age
women is having fewer children, as women increase their educational
attainment, workforce participation, and use of family planning
methods; delay marriage; and opt for smaller families.As the proportion of working-age South Africans has grown
relative to children and the elderly, South Africa has been unable
to achieve a demographic dividend because persistent high
unemployment and the prevalence of HIV/AIDs have created a
larger-than-normal dependent population. HIV/AIDS was also
responsible for South Africa’s average life expectancy plunging to
less than 43 years in 2008; it has rebounded to 65 years as of
2022. HIV/AIDS continues to be a serious public health threat,
although awareness-raising campaigns and the wider availability of
anti-retroviral drugs is stabilizing the number of new cases,
enabling infected individuals to live longer, healthier lives, and
reducing mother-child transmissions.Migration to South Africa began in the second half of the 17th
century when traders from the Dutch East India Company settled in
the Cape and started using slaves from South and southeast Asia
(mainly from India but also from present-day Indonesia, Bangladesh,
Sri Lanka, and Malaysia) and southeast Africa (Madagascar and
Mozambique) as farm laborers and, to a lesser extent, as domestic
servants. The Indian subcontinent remained the Cape Colony’s main
source of slaves in the early 18th century, while slaves were
increasingly obtained from southeast Africa in the latter part of
the 18th century and into the 19th century under British rule.After slavery was completely abolished in the British Empire in
1838, South Africa’s colonists turned to temporary African migrants
and indentured labor through agreements with India and later China,
countries that were anxious to export workers to alleviate domestic
poverty and overpopulation. Of the more than 150,000 indentured
Indian laborers hired to work in Natal’s sugar plantations between
1860 and 1911, most exercised the right as British subjects to
remain permanently (a small number of Indian immigrants came freely
as merchants). Because of growing resentment toward Indian workers,
the 63,000 indentured Chinese workers who mined gold in Transvaal
between 1904 and 1911 were under more restrictive contracts and
generally were forced to return to their homeland.In the late 19th century and nearly the entire 20th century,
South Africa’s then British colonies’ and Dutch states’ enforced
selective immigration policies that welcomed "assimilable" white
Europeans as permanent residents but excluded or restricted other
immigrants. Following the Union of South Africa’s passage of a law
in 1913 prohibiting Asian and other non-white immigrants and its
elimination of the indenture system in 1917, temporary African
contract laborers from neighboring countries became the dominant
source of labor in the burgeoning mining industries. Others worked
in agriculture and smaller numbers in manufacturing, domestic
service, transportation, and construction. Throughout the 20th
century, at least 40% of South Africa’s miners were foreigners; the
numbers peaked at over 80% in the late 1960s. Mozambique, Lesotho,
Botswana, and Eswatini were the primary sources of miners, and
Malawi and Zimbabwe were periodic suppliers.Under apartheid, a "two gates" migration policy focused on
policing and deporting illegal migrants rather than on managing
migration to meet South Africa’s development needs. The
exclusionary 1991 Aliens Control Act limited labor recruitment to
the highly skilled as defined by the ruling white minority, while
bilateral labor agreements provided exemptions that enabled the
influential mining industry and, to a lesser extent, commercial
farms, to hire temporary, low-paid workers from neighboring states.
Illegal African migrants were often tacitly allowed to work for low
pay in other sectors but were always under threat of
deportation.The abolishment of apartheid in 1994 led to the development of a
new inclusive national identity and the strengthening of the
country’s restrictive immigration policy. Despite South Africa’s
protectionist approach to immigration, the downsizing and closing
of mines, and rising unemployment, migrants from across the
continent believed that the country held work opportunities. Fewer
African labor migrants were issued temporary work permits and,
instead, increasingly entered South Africa with visitors’ permits
or came illegally, which drove growth in cross-border trade and the
informal job market. A new wave of Asian immigrants has also
arrived over the last two decades, many operating small retail
businesses.In the post-apartheid period, increasing numbers of highly
skilled white workers emigrated, citing dissatisfaction with the
political situation, crime, poor services, and a reduced quality of
life. The 2002 Immigration Act and later amendments were intended
to facilitate the temporary migration of skilled foreign labor to
fill labor shortages, but instead the legislation continues to
create regulatory obstacles. Although the education system has
improved and brain drain has slowed in the wake of the 2008 global
financial crisis, South Africa continues to face skills shortages
in several key sectors, such as health care and technology.South Africa’s stability and economic growth has acted as a
magnet for refugees and asylum seekers from nearby countries,
despite the prevalence of discrimination and xenophobic violence.
Refugees have included an estimated 350,000 Mozambicans during its
1980s civil war and, more recently, several thousand Somalis,
Congolese, and Ethiopians. Nearly all of the tens of thousands of
Zimbabweans who have applied for asylum in South Africa have been
categorized as economic migrants and denied refuge.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">South Africa’s telecom sector boasts one of the most advanced infrastructures on the continent; the focus in recent years has been on back haul capacity and on fiber and LTE networks to extend and improve internet service connectivity; with the ongoing migration to fiber, the incumbent telco expects to close down its copper network in 2024; the mobile sector has developed strongly in recent years, partly due to the poor availability and level of service of fixed-line networks, which meant that many people had no alternative to mobile networks for voice and data services; the multi-spectrum auction was delayed several times due to legal wrangling, and was finally held in March 2022; the delay caused difficulties for network operators, which were forced to reform spectrum for 3G and LTE use, and provide 5G services on temporary licenses; six qualified bidders acquired spectrum, netting the regulator ZAR14.4 billion in revenues; the market is shrugging off the impact of the pandemic, which had a significant impact on production and supply chains globally, and saw a slowdown in some network expansions, particularly around 5G; on the consumer side, spending on telecoms services and devices remains slightly under pressure amid ongoing macroeconomic challenges facing the country; the crucial nature of telecom services, both for general communication as well as a tool for home-working, will offset such pressures; in many markets the net effect should be a steady though reduced increase in subscriber growth (2022)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>

      <subsection title="Military - note">the SANDF was created in 1994 to replace the South African
Defense Force (SADF); the SANDF was opened to all South Africans
who met military requirements, while the SADF was a mostly white
force (only whites were subject to conscription) with non-whites
only allowed to join in a voluntary capacity; the SANDF also
absorbed members of the guerrilla and militia forces of the various
anti-apartheid opposition groups, including the African National
Congress, the Pan Africanist Congress, and the Inkatha Freedom
Party, as well as the security forces of the formerly independent
Bantustan homelands; the SANDF is one of Africa’s most capable
militaries; over the past decade, however, its operational
readiness and modernization programs have been hampered by funding
shortfalls; it participates regularly in African and UN
peacekeeping missions and has the ability to independently deploy
throughout Africa (2022)</subsection>
