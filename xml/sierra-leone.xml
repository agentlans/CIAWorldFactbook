   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Continuously populated for at least 2,500 years, the dense
jungle in the area of Sierra Leone allowed the region to remain
relatively protected from invaders from empires in West Africa.
Traders introduced Sierra Leone to Islam, which occupies a central
role in Sierra Leonean culture and history. In the 17th
century, the British set up a trading post near present-day
Freetown. The trade originally involved timber and ivory but later
expanded to enslaved people. In 1787, following the American
Revolution, Sierra Leone became a destination for Black British
loyalists from the new United States. After the abolition of the
slave trade in 1807, British ships delivered thousands of liberated
Africans to Sierra Leone. During the 19th century, the
colony gradually expanded inland.In 1961, Sierra Leone became independent of the UK. While Sierra
Leone held free and fair elections in 1962 and 1967, Siaka STEVENS
- Sierra Leone’s second prime minister - quickly reverted to
authoritarian tendencies, outlawing most political parties and
ruling from 1967 to 1985. In 1991, Sierra Leonean soldiers launched
a civil war against STEVENS’ ruling party. The war caused tens of
thousands of deaths and displaced more than 2 million people (about
one third of the population). In 1998, a Nigerian-led West African
coalition military force intervened, installing Tejan KABBAH - who
was originally elected in 1996 - as prime minister. In 2002, KABBAH
officially announced the end of the war. Since 1998, Sierra Leone
has conducted uninterrupted democratic elections, dominated by the
two main political parties. In 2018, Julius Maada BIO of the Sierra
Leone People’s Party won the presidential election that saw a high
voter turnout despite some allegations of voter intimidation. The
next presidential election is scheduled for March 2023.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Sierra Leone’s youthful and growing population is driven by its
high total fertility rate (TFR) of almost 4 children per woman as
of 2022, which has declined little over the last two decades. Its
elevated TFR is sustained by the continued desire for large
families, the low level of contraceptive use, and the early start
of childbearing. Despite its high TFR, Sierra Leone’s population
growth is somewhat tempered by high infant, child, and maternal
mortality rates that are among the world’s highest and are a result
of poverty, a lack of potable water and sanitation, poor nutrition,
limited access to quality health care services, and the prevalence
of female genital cutting.Sierra Leone’s large youth cohort – about 60% of the population
is under the age of 25 – continues to struggle with high levels of
unemployment, which was one of the major causes of the country’s
1991-2002 civil war and remains a threat to stability today. Its
estimated 60% youth unemployment rate is attributed to high levels
of illiteracy and unskilled labor, a lack of private sector jobs,
and low pay.Sierra Leone has been a source of and destination for refugees.
Sierra Leone’s civil war internally displaced as many as 2 million
people, or almost half the population, and forced almost another
half million to seek refuge in neighboring countries (370,000
Sierra Leoneans fled to Guinea and 120,000 to Liberia). The UNHCR
has helped almost 180,000 Sierra Leoneans to return home, while
more than 90,000 others have repatriated on their own. Of the more
than 65,000 Liberians who took refuge in Sierra Leone during their
country’s civil war (1989-2003), about 50,000 have been voluntarily
repatriated by the UNHCR and others have returned home
independently.</subsection>
