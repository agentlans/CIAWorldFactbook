   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Discovered in 1493 by Christopher COLUMBUS who named it for his
brother Bartolomeo, Saint Barthelemy was first settled by the
French in 1648. In 1784, the French sold the island to Sweden,
which renamed the largest town Gustavia, after the Swedish King
GUSTAV III, and made it a free port; the island prospered as a
trade and supply center during the colonial wars of the 18th
century. France repurchased the island in 1877 and took control the
following year. It was placed under the administration of
Guadeloupe. Saint Barthelemy retained its free port status along
with various Swedish appellations such as Swedish street and town
names, and the three-crown symbol on the coat of arms. In 2003, the
islanders voted to secede from Guadeloupe, and in 2007, the island
became a French overseas collectivity. In 2012, it became an
overseas territory of the EU, allowing it to exert local control
over the permanent and temporary immigration of foreign workers
including non-French European citizens. Hurricane Irma hit the
island in September 2017 causing extensive damage, but Saint
Barthelemy recovered by early 2018.</subsection>
