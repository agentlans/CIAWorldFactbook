   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Much of the area of present-day Cameroon was ruled by powerful
chiefdoms before becoming a German colony in 1884 known as Kamerun.
After World War I, the territory was divided between France and the
UK as League of Nations mandates. French Cameroon became
independent in 1960 as the Republic of Cameroon. The following year
the southern portion of neighboring British Cameroon voted to merge
with the new country to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon. In
1972, a new constitution replaced the federation with a unitary
state, the United Republic of Cameroon. The country has generally
enjoyed stability, which has enabled the development of
agriculture, roads, and railways, as well as a petroleum industry.
Despite slow movement toward democratic reform, political power
remains firmly in the hands of President Paul BIYA.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Cameroon has a large youth population, with more than 60% of the
populace under the age of 25 as of 2020. Fertility is falling but
remains at a high level, especially among poor, rural, and
uneducated women, in part because of inadequate access to
contraception. Life expectancy remains low at about 55 years due to
the prevalence of HIV and AIDs and an elevated maternal mortality
rate, which has remained high since 1990. Cameroon, particularly
the northern region, is vulnerable to food insecurity largely
because of government mismanagement, corruption, high production
costs, inadequate infrastructure, and natural disasters. Despite
economic growth in some regions, poverty is on the rise, and is
most prevalent in rural areas, which are especially affected by a
shortage of jobs, declining incomes, poor school and health care
infrastructure, and a lack of clean water and sanitation.
Underinvestment in social safety nets and ineffective public
financial management also contribute to Cameroon’s high rate of
poverty.  The activities of Boko Haram, other armed groups,
and counterinsurgency operations have worsened food insecurity in
the Far North region.  International migration has been driven by unemployment
(including fewer government jobs), poverty, the search for
educational opportunities, and corruption. The US and Europe are
preferred destinations, but, with tighter immigration restrictions
in these countries, young Cameroonians are increasingly turning to
neighboring states, such as Gabon and Nigeria, South Africa, other
parts of Africa, and the Near and Far East. Cameroon’s limited
resources make it dependent on UN support to host more than 480,000
refugees and asylum seekers as of December 2022. These refugees and
asylum seekers are primarily from the Central African Republic and
Nigeria.  Internal and external displacement have grown
dramatically in recent years.  Boko Haram's attacks and
counterattacks by government forces in the Far North since 2014
have increased the number of internally displaced people. 
Armed conflict between separatists and Cameroon's military in the
Northwest and Southwest since 2016 have displaced hundreds of
thousands of the country's Anglophone minority.</subsection>

      </subsection>
      <subsection title="Military - note">the FAC's air, ground, and gendarmerie forces are largely
focused on the threat from the terrorist group Boko Haram along its
frontiers with Nigeria and Chad (Far North region) and an
insurgency from armed Anglophone separatist groups in the
North-West and South-West regions (as of 2023, this internal
conflict has left more than 3,500 civilians dead and over 500,000
people displaced since fighting started in 2016); in addition,
ground units are often deployed units to the border region with the
Central African Republic to counter intrusions from armed militias
and bandits; the Navy is focused on protecting Cameroon's oil
installations, combating crime and piracy in the Gulf of Guinea,
and patrolling the country's rivers and lakes (2023)</subsection>
      <subsection title="Maritime threats">the International Maritime Bureau reports the territorial and
offshore waters in the Niger Delta and Gulf of Guinea remain a very
high risk for piracy and armed robbery of ships; in 2021, there
were 34 reported incidents of piracy and armed robbery at sea in
the Gulf of Guinea region; although a significant decrease from the
total number of 81 incidents in 2020, it included the one hijacking
and three of five ships fired upon worldwide; while boarding and
attempted boarding to steal valuables from ships and crews are the
most common types of incidents, almost a third of all incidents
involve a hijacking and/or kidnapping; in 2021, 57 crew members
were kidnapped in seven separate incidents in the Gulf of Guinea,
representing 100% of maritime kidnappings worldwide; Nigerian
pirates in particular are well armed and very aggressive, operating
as far as 200 nm offshore; the Maritime Administration of the US
Department of Transportation has issued a Maritime Advisory
(2022-001 - Gulf of Guinea-Piracy/Armed Robbery/Kidnapping for
Ransom) effective 4 January 2022, which states in part, "Piracy,
armed robbery, and kidnapping for ransom continue to serve as
significant threats to US-flagged vessels transiting or operating
in the Gulf of Guinea"</subsection>

         <note title=" ">Cameroon does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking but is making significant efforts to do so; authorities prosecuted and convicted more alleged traffickers; the government extended the 2020-2021 national action plan for an additional two years and conducted trafficking awareness  activities; however, the government did not demonstrate overall increasing efforts to improve anti-trafficking capacity; officials investigated fewer trafficking cases and identified fewer victims, and did not investigate allegations of security forces involvement in sexual exploitation of women; officials prosecuted and convicted fewer traffickers; standard operating procedures for the identification and referral of trafficking victims were not widely disseminated; the government did not pass draft anti-trafficking legislation pending since 2012 to address victim and witness protection in conformity with international law; nonetheless, because the government devoted sufficient efforts to meet the minimum standards, Cameroon was granted a waiver per the TVPA from a downgrade to Tier 3, therefore Cameroon remained on Tier 2 Watch List for a third consecutive year (2022)</note>
         <note title="trafficking profile">human traffickers exploit domestic and foreign victims in Cameroon, and traffickers exploit victims from Cameroon abroad; deteriorating economic and education conditions and diminished police and judicial presence caused by conflict in the Northwest and Southwest has left displaced persons vulnerable to trafficking; parents may be lured by promises of education or a better life for their children in urban areas, and then the children are subject to forced labor and sex trafficking; teenagers and adolescents may be lured to cities with promises of employment and then become victims of forced labor and sex trafficking; children from neighboring countries are forced to work in spare parts shops or cattle grazing by business owners and herders; Cameroonians, often from rural areas, are exploited in forced labor and sex trafficking in the Middle East, Europe, the United States, and African countries (2022)</note>
