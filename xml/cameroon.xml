   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Much of the area of present-day Cameroon was ruled by powerful
chiefdoms before becoming a German colony in 1884 known as Kamerun.
After World War I, the territory was divided between France and the
UK as League of Nations mandates. French Cameroon became
independent in 1960 as the Republic of Cameroon. The following year
the southern portion of neighboring British Cameroon voted to merge
with the new country to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon. In
1972, a new constitution replaced the federation with a unitary
state, the United Republic of Cameroon. The country has generally
enjoyed stability, which has enabled the development of
agriculture, roads, and railways, as well as a petroleum industry.
Despite slow movement toward democratic reform, political power
remains firmly in the hands of President Paul BIYA.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Cameroon has a large youth population, with more than 60% of the
populace under the age of 25 as of 2020. Fertility is falling but
remains at a high level, especially among poor, rural, and
uneducated women, in part because of inadequate access to
contraception. Life expectancy remains low at about 55 years due to
the prevalence of HIV and AIDs and an elevated maternal mortality
rate, which has remained high since 1990. Cameroon, particularly
the northern region, is vulnerable to food insecurity largely
because of government mismanagement, corruption, high production
costs, inadequate infrastructure, and natural disasters. Despite
economic growth in some regions, poverty is on the rise, and is
most prevalent in rural areas, which are especially affected by a
shortage of jobs, declining incomes, poor school and health care
infrastructure, and a lack of clean water and sanitation.
Underinvestment in social safety nets and ineffective public
financial management also contribute to Cameroon’s high rate of
poverty.  The activities of Boko Haram, other armed groups,
and counterinsurgency operations have worsened food insecurity in
the Far North region.  International migration has been driven by unemployment
(including fewer government jobs), poverty, the search for
educational opportunities, and corruption. The US and Europe are
preferred destinations, but, with tighter immigration restrictions
in these countries, young Cameroonians are increasingly turning to
neighboring states, such as Gabon and Nigeria, South Africa, other
parts of Africa, and the Near and Far East. Cameroon’s limited
resources make it dependent on UN support to host more than 480,000
refugees and asylum seekers as of December 2022. These refugees and
asylum seekers are primarily from the Central African Republic and
Nigeria.  Internal and external displacement have grown
dramatically in recent years.  Boko Haram's attacks and
counterattacks by government forces in the Far North since 2014
have increased the number of internally displaced people. 
Armed conflict between separatists and Cameroon's military in the
Northwest and Southwest since 2016 have displaced hundreds of
thousands of the country's Anglophone minority.</subsection>

note: on 21 March 2022, the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Travel Alert for polio in
Africa; Cameroon is currently considered a high risk to travelers
for circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV);
vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) is a strain of the weakened
poliovirus that was initially included in oral polio vaccine (OPV)
and that has changed over time and behaves more like the wild
or naturally occurring virus; this means it can be spread more
easily to people who are unvaccinated against polio and who come in
contact with the stool or respiratory secretions, such as from a
sneeze, of an “infected” person who received oral polio vaccine;
the CDC recommends that before any international travel, anyone
unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated, or with an unknown polio
vaccination status should complete the routine polio vaccine
series; before travel to any high-risk destination, the CDC
recommends that adults who previously completed the full, routine
polio vaccine series receive a single, lifetime booster dose of

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Cameroon was for many years
one of the few countries in Africa with only two competing mobile
operators; the investment programs among operators over the next
few years will considerably boost mobile broadband services in
rural areas of the country, many of which are under served by
fixed-line infrastructure; the government has also been supportive,
having launched its ‘Cameroon Digital 2020’ program, aimed at
improving connectivity nationally; improved submarine and
terrestrial cable connectivity has substantially increased
international bandwidth, in turn leading to reductions in access
prices for consumers; other projects such as Acceleration of the
Digital Transformation of Cameroon are aimed at developing the
digital economy (2022)<br/>
         <br/>

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

2,000-2,500 troops to the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF)
against Boko Haram and other terrorist groups operating in the
general area of the Lake Chad Basin and along Nigeria's northeast
border; national MNJTF troop contingents are deployed within their
own country territories, although cross‐border operations occur
occasionally</subsection>
      <subsection title="Military - note">the FAC's air, ground, and gendarmerie forces are largely
focused on the threat from the terrorist group Boko Haram along its
frontiers with Nigeria and Chad (Far North region) and an
insurgency from armed Anglophone separatist groups in the
North-West and South-West regions (as of 2023, this internal
conflict has left more than 3,500 civilians dead and over 500,000
people displaced since fighting started in 2016); in addition,
ground units are often deployed units to the border region with the
Central African Republic to counter intrusions from armed militias
and bandits; the Navy is focused on protecting Cameroon's oil
installations, combating crime and piracy in the Gulf of Guinea,
and patrolling the country's rivers and lakes (2023)</subsection>
      <subsection title="Maritime threats">the International Maritime Bureau reports the territorial and
offshore waters in the Niger Delta and Gulf of Guinea remain a very
high risk for piracy and armed robbery of ships; in 2021, there
were 34 reported incidents of piracy and armed robbery at sea in
the Gulf of Guinea region; although a significant decrease from the
total number of 81 incidents in 2020, it included the one hijacking
and three of five ships fired upon worldwide; while boarding and
attempted boarding to steal valuables from ships and crews are the
most common types of incidents, almost a third of all incidents
involve a hijacking and/or kidnapping; in 2021, 57 crew members
were kidnapped in seven separate incidents in the Gulf of Guinea,
representing 100% of maritime kidnappings worldwide; Nigerian
pirates in particular are well armed and very aggressive, operating
as far as 200 nm offshore; the Maritime Administration of the US
Department of Transportation has issued a Maritime Advisory
(2022-001 - Gulf of Guinea-Piracy/Armed Robbery/Kidnapping for
Ransom) effective 4 January 2022, which states in part, "Piracy,
armed robbery, and kidnapping for ransom continue to serve as
significant threats to US-flagged vessels transiting or operating
in the Gulf of Guinea"</subsection>

      <subsection title="Trafficking in persons">tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List
— Cameroon does not fully meet the minimum
standards for the elimination of trafficking but is making
significant efforts to do so; authorities prosecuted and convicted
more alleged traffickers; the government extended the 2020-2021
national action plan for an additional two years and conducted
trafficking awareness  activities; however, the government did
not demonstrate overall increasing efforts to improve
anti-trafficking capacity; officials investigated fewer trafficking
cases and identified fewer victims, and did not investigate
allegations of security forces involvement in sexual exploitation
of women; officials prosecuted and convicted fewer traffickers;
standard operating procedures for the identification and referral
of trafficking victims were not widely disseminated; the government
did not pass draft anti-trafficking legislation pending since 2012
to address victim and witness protection in conformity with
international law; nonetheless, because the government devoted
sufficient efforts to meet the minimum standards, Cameroon was
granted a waiver per the TVPA from a downgrade to Tier 3, therefore
Cameroon remained on Tier 2 Watch List for a third consecutive year
(2022)<br/>
         <br/>
trafficking profile: human traffickers exploit
domestic and foreign victims in Cameroon, and traffickers exploit
victims from Cameroon abroad; deteriorating economic and education
conditions and diminished police and judicial presence caused by
conflict in the Northwest and Southwest has left displaced persons
vulnerable to trafficking; parents may be lured by promises of
education or a better life for their children in urban areas, and
then the children are subject to forced labor and sex trafficking;
teenagers and adolescents may be lured to cities with promises of
employment and then become victims of forced labor and sex
trafficking; children from neighboring countries are forced to work
in spare parts shops or cattle grazing by business owners and
herders; Cameroonians, often from rural areas, are exploited in
forced labor and sex trafficking in the Middle East, Europe, the
United States, and African countries (2022)</subsection>
