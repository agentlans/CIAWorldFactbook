   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The island - "discovered" by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1494 - was
settled by the Spanish early in the 16th century. The Native Taino,
who had inhabited Jamaica for centuries, were gradually
exterminated and replaced by African slaves. England seized the
island in 1655 and established a plantation economy based on sugar,
cocoa, and coffee. The abolition of slavery in 1834 freed a quarter
million slaves, many of whom became small farmers. Jamaica
gradually increased its independence from Britain. In 1958, it
joined other British Caribbean colonies in forming the Federation
of the West Indies. Jamaica withdrew from the Federation in 1961
and gained full independence in 1962. Deteriorating economic
conditions during the 1970s led to recurrent violence as rival
gangs affiliated with the major political parties evolved into
powerful organized crime networks involved in international drug
smuggling and money laundering. Violent crime, drug trafficking,
corruption, the COVID-19 pandemic, and poverty pose significant
challenges to the government today. Nonetheless, many rural and
resort areas remain relatively safe and contribute substantially to
the economy.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">Jamaica’s telecom sector has for many years been propped up by the mobile sector, which accounts for the vast majority of internet connections and voice lines; it also accounts for just over half of telecom sector revenue; in December 2020, the government announced the rollout of a national broadband network costing up to $237 million; the funding will be spent on improving connectivity in under served areas, improving access to education, and deploying networks to public locations such as hospitals, municipal institutions, and police stations; to aid in this national broadband effort, the government received a donation of 650km of fiber cabling from local cable TV providers and the two main toll road operators; to encourage the use of digital channels as the country deals with the Covid-19 pandemic (2021)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>
