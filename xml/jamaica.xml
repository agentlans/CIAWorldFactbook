   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The island - "discovered" by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1494 - was
settled by the Spanish early in the 16th century. The Native Taino,
who had inhabited Jamaica for centuries, were gradually
exterminated and replaced by African slaves. England seized the
island in 1655 and established a plantation economy based on sugar,
cocoa, and coffee. The abolition of slavery in 1834 freed a quarter
million slaves, many of whom became small farmers. Jamaica
gradually increased its independence from Britain. In 1958, it
joined other British Caribbean colonies in forming the Federation
of the West Indies. Jamaica withdrew from the Federation in 1961
and gained full independence in 1962. Deteriorating economic
conditions during the 1970s led to recurrent violence as rival
gangs affiliated with the major political parties evolved into
powerful organized crime networks involved in international drug
smuggling and money laundering. Violent crime, drug trafficking,
corruption, the COVID-19 pandemic, and poverty pose significant
challenges to the government today. Nonetheless, many rural and
resort areas remain relatively safe and contribute substantially to
the economy.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Jamaica’s telecom sector
has for many years been propped up by the mobile sector, which
accounts for the vast majority of internet connections and voice
lines; it also accounts for just over half of telecom sector
revenue; in December 2020, the government announced the rollout of
a national broadband network costing up to $237 million; the
funding will be spent on improving connectivity in under served
areas, improving access to education, and deploying networks to
public locations such as hospitals, municipal institutions, and
police stations; to aid in this national broadband effort, the
government received a donation of 650km of fiber cabling from local
cable TV providers and the two main toll road operators; to
encourage the use of digital channels as the country deals with the
Covid-19 pandemic (2021)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line subscriptions nearly 15 per
100, cellular-mobile roughly 97 per 100 subscriptions (2020)<br/>

international: country code - 1-876 and 1-658;
landing points for the ALBA-1, CFX-1, Fibralink, East-West, and
Cayman-Jamaican Fiber System submarine cables providing connections
to South America, parts of the Caribbean, Central America and the
US; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean)
(2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
