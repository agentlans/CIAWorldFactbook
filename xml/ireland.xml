   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Celtic tribes arrived on the island between 600 and 150 B.C.
Invasions by Norsemen that began in the late 8th century were
finally ended when King Brian BORU defeated the Danes in 1014.
Norman invasions began in the 12th century and set off more than
seven centuries of Anglo-Irish struggle marked by fierce rebellions
and harsh repressions. The Irish famine of the mid-19th century was
responsible for a drop in the island's population by more than one
quarter through starvation, disease, and emigration. For more than
a century afterward, the population of the island continued to fall
only to begin growing again in the 1960s. Over the last 50 years,
Ireland's high birthrate has made it demographically one of the
youngest populations in the EU.The modern Irish state traces its origins to the failed 1916
Easter Monday Uprising that galvanized nationalist sentiment and
fostered a guerrilla war resulting in independence from the UK in
1921 with the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty and the creation of
the Irish Free State. The treaty was deeply controversial in
Ireland in part because it helped solidify the partition of
Ireland, with six of the island's 32 counties remaining in the UK
as Northern Ireland. The split between pro-Treaty and anti-Treaty
partisans led to the Irish Civil War (1922-23). The traditionally
dominant political parties in Ireland, Fine Gael and Fianna Fail,
are de facto descendants of the opposing sides of the treaty
debate. Ireland formally left the British Dominion in 1949 when
Ireland declared itself a republic.<br/>
         <br/>
Deep sectarian divides between the Catholic and Protestant
populations and systemic discrimination in Northern Ireland erupted
into years of violence known as the "Troubles" that began in the
1960s. In 1998, the governments of Ireland and the UK, along with
most political parties in Northern Ireland, reached the
Belfast/Good Friday Agreement with the support of the US. This
agreement helped end the Troubles and initiated a new phase of
cooperation between the Irish and British Governments.<br/>
         <br/>
Ireland was neutral in World War II and continues its policy of
military neutrality. Ireland joined the European Community in 1973
and the euro-zone currency union in 1999. The economic boom years
of the Celtic Tiger (1995-2007) saw rapid economic growth, which
came to an abrupt end in 2008 with the meltdown of the Irish
banking system. As a small, open economy, Ireland has excelled at
courting foreign direct investment, especially from US
multi-nationals, which helped the economy recover from the
financial crisis and insolated it from the economic shocks of the
COVID-19 pandemic.</subsection>

symbolizes peace (or a lasting truce) between the green and the

has rebounded from a long period in which fiscal constraints
inhibited investment in the sector; significant infrastructure
projects are underway, including the NBN which aims to deliver a
fiber-based service of at least 150Mb/s nationally by the end of
2022; the renewed optimism has been seen in company investment in
extending fiber-based networks providing 1Gb/s services; the mobile
sector is preparing for a multi-frequency availability later in
2021 which will greatly increase the amount of frequencies
available, and provide a boost for 5G services; the MNOs are

significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
