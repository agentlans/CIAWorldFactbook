   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Tokelau, which comprises three atolls, was first settled by
Polynesians around A.D. 1000. The three atolls operated relatively
independently but had contact with one another, intermarrying and
occasionally fighting wars. Fakaofo Atoll eventually subjugated the
other two. British explorer John BYRON was the first European to
see Atafu Atoll in 1765. British naval officer Edward EDWARDS saw
Nukunonu Atoll in 1791, and ships occasionally continued to pass by
Atafu and Nukunonu. In 1835, a US whaling ship became the first
non-Pacific island ship to pass by Fakaofo. Catholic and Protestant
missionaries arrived in 1845 and converted the population on the
islands on which they landed. To this day, Nukunonu is
predominantly Catholic while Atafu is mostly Protestant; Catholic
and Protestant missionaries both worked in Fakaofo, and the
population there is more mixed.

In 1863, Peruvian slave traders, masquerading as missionaries,
kidnapped nearly all the men from Tokelau, and local governance
moved to a system based on a Council of Elders, which still exists
today. The atolls were repopulated when new Polynesian settlers and
American and European migrants intermarried with local Tokelauan
women. Tokelau became a British protectorate in 1889 and included
in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Protectorate - later a colony -
in 1908. In 1925, the UK placed Tokelau under New Zealand
administration. The Tokelau Islands Act of 1948 formally
transferred sovereignty from the UK to New Zealand and Tokelauans
were granted New Zealand citizenship. In 1979, the US relinquished
its claims over Tokelau in the Treaty of Tokehega, and Tokelau
relinquished its claims over Swains Island, which is part of
American Samoa.

Economic opportunities in Tokelau are sparse, and about 80% of
Tokelauans live in New Zealand. Tokelau held two self-governance
referendums in 2006 and 2007, in which more than 60% of voters
chose to go into free association with New Zealand; however, the
referendums failed to achieve the two-thirds majority necessary to
enact a status change. Tokelau lacks an airport and is only
accessible via a day-long boat trip from Samoa, although a site for
an airstrip on Nukunonu was selected in 2019. Because of its
dependency on Samoa for transportation, in 2011, Tokelau followed
Samoaâ€™s lead and shifted the international date line to its east,
skipping December 30 and becoming one hour ahead of New Zealand
rather than 23 hours behind.</subsection>
