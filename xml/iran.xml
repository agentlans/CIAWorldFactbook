   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Known as Persia until 1935, Iran became an Islamic republic in
1979 after the ruling monarchy was overthrown and Shah Mohammad
Reza PAHLAVI was forced into exile. Conservative clerical forces
led by Ayatollah Ruhollah KHOMEINI established a theocratic system
of government with ultimate political authority vested in a learned
religious scholar referred to commonly as the Supreme Leader who,
according to the constitution, is accountable only to the Assembly
of Experts - a popularly elected 88-member body of clerics.
US-Iranian relations became strained when a group of Iranian
students seized the US Embassy in Tehran in November 1979 and held
embassy personnel hostage until mid-January 1981. The US cut off
diplomatic relations with Iran in April 1980. During the period
1980-88, Iran fought a bloody, indecisive war with Iraq that
eventually expanded into the Persian Gulf and led to clashes
between US Navy and Iranian military forces. Iran has been
designated a state sponsor of terrorism and was subject to US, UN,
and EU economic sanctions and export controls because of its
continued involvement in terrorism and concerns over possible
military dimensions of its nuclear program until Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) Implementation Day in 2016.
The US began gradually re-imposing sanctions on Iran after the US
withdrawal from JCPOA in May 2018.Following the election of reformer Hojjat ol-Eslam Mohammad
KHATAMI as president in 1997 and a reformist Majles (legislature)
in 2000, a campaign to foster political reform in response to
popular dissatisfaction was initiated. The movement floundered as
conservative politicians, supported by the Supreme Leader,
unelected institutions of authority like the Council of Guardians,
and the security services reversed and blocked reform measures
while increasing security repression. Starting with nationwide
municipal elections in 2003 and continuing through Majles elections
in 2004, conservatives reestablished control over Iran's elected
government institutions, which culminated with the August 2005
inauguration of hardliner Mahmud AHMADI-NEJAD as president. His
controversial reelection in June 2009 sparked nationwide protests
over allegations of electoral fraud, but the protests were quickly
suppressed. Deteriorating economic conditions due primarily to
government mismanagement and international sanctions prompted at
least two major economically based protests in July and October
2012, but Iran's internal security situation remained stable.
President AHMADI-NEJAD's independent streak angered regime
establishment figures, including the Supreme Leader, leading to
conservative opposition to his agenda for the last year of his
presidency, and an alienation of his political supporters. In June
2013, Iranians elected a centrist cleric Dr. Hasan Fereidun RUHANI
to the presidency. A longtime senior member in the regime, he made
promises of reforming society and Iran's foreign policy. In July
2015, Iran and the five permanent members, plus Germany (P5+1)
signed the JCPOA under which Iran agreed to restrictions on its
nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief; however, the US
reimposed sanctions in 2018 dealing a blow to RUHANI's legacy and
the Iranian economy. Negotiations to restore the deal started in
2021 and are ongoing. Iran held elections in February 2020 for the
Majles and the president in June 2021, resulting in a hardline and
conservative monopoly across the regime's elected and unelected
institutions. President Ebrahim RAISI is a hardline cleric with a
decades-long career in Iran's judiciary and has had limited foreign
policy and economic experience.</subsection>

comparison to the world: 49</subsection>
      <subsection title="Military and security service personnel strengths">information varies; approximately 550-600,000 active armed
forces personnel; approximately 400,000 Islamic Republic of Iran
Regular Forces (350,000 Ground Forces; 18,000 Navy; 40,000 Air
Force/Air Defense Forces); approximately 150-190,000 Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps (100-150,000 Ground Forces; 20,000 Navy;
15,000 Aerospace Force; 5-15,000 Qods Force); estimated 90,000
active Basij Paramilitary Forces (2022)</subsection>
      <subsection title="Military equipment inventories and acquisitions">the Iranian military's inventory includes a mix of domestically
produced and mostly older foreign equipment largely of Chinese,
Russian, Soviet, and US origin (US equipment acquired prior to the
Islamic Revolution in 1979); Iran has also received some military
equipment from North Korea, including midget submarines and
ballistic missiles; Iran has a defense industry with the capacity
to develop, produce, support, and sustain air, land, missile, and
naval weapons programs (2022)</subsection>

years of age for volunteers; 17 years of age for Law Enforcement
Forces; 15 years of age for Basij Forces (Popular Mobilization
Army); conscript military service obligation is 18-24 months,

      <subsection title="Military deployments">estimated to have up to 3,000 military personnel in Syria
(2022)
<note title="note">Iran has recruited, trained, and funded thousands of Syrian and foreign fighters to support the ASAD regime during the Syrian civil war</note>
      </subsection>
      <subsection title="Military - note">the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) was formed in May
1979 in the immediate aftermath of Shah Mohammad Reza PAHLAVI’s
fall, as leftists, nationalists, and Islamists jockeyed for power;
while the interim prime minister controlled the government and
state institutions, such as the Army, followers of Ayatollah
Ruhollah KHOMEINI organized counterweights, including the IRGC, to
protect the Islamic revolution; the IRGC’s command structure
bypassed the elected president and went directly to KHOMEINI; the
Iran-Iraq War (1980–88) transformed the IRGC into more of a
conventional fighting force with its own ground, air, naval, and
special forces, plus control over Iran’s strategic missile and
rocket forces; as of 2022, the IRGC was a highly institutionalized
and parallel military force to Iran’s regular armed forces
(Artesh); it was heavily involved in internal security and had
significant influence in the political and economic spheres of
Iranian society, as well as Iran’s foreign policy; on the economic
front, it owned factories and corporations and subsidiaries in
banking, infrastructure, housing, airlines, tourism and other
sectors; its special operations forces, known as the Qods/Quds
Force, specialized in foreign missions and has provided advice,
funding, guidance, material support, training, and weapons to
militants in countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen,
as well as extremist groups, including HAMAS, Hizballah, Kata’ib
Hizballah, and Palestine Islamic Jihad (see Appendix
T for additional details on the IRGC and Qods Force); the Qods
Force also conducts intelligence and reconnaissance
operations 

the Supreme Council for National Security (SCNS) is the senior-most
body for formulating Iran’s foreign and security policy; it is
formally chaired by the president, who also appoints the SCNS
secretary; its members include the speaker of the Majles, the head
of the judiciary, the chief of the Armed Forces General Staff
(chief of defense or CHOD), the commanders of the Artesh (regular
forces) and IRGC, and the ministers of defense, foreign affairs,
interior, and intelligence; the SCNS reports to the supreme leader;
the supreme leader is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces

      <subsection title="Maritime threats">the Maritime Administration of the US Department of
Transportation has issued a Maritime Advisory (2022-003 Persian
Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, Gulf of Oman, Arabian Sea, Red Sea-Threats
to US and International Shipping from Iran) effective 28 February
2022, which states in part that "heightened military activities and
increased political tensions in this region continue to present
risk to commercial shipping...there is a continued possibility that
Iran and/or its regional proxies could take actions against US and
partner interests in the region;" Coalition Task Force (CTF)
Sentinel has been established to provide escorts for commercial
shipping transiting the Persian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, and Gulf of
Oman</subsection>
