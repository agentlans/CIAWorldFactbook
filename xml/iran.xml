   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Known as Persia until 1935, Iran became an Islamic republic in
1979 after the ruling monarchy was overthrown and Shah Mohammad
Reza PAHLAVI was forced into exile. Conservative clerical forces
led by Ayatollah Ruhollah KHOMEINI established a theocratic system
of government with ultimate political authority vested in a learned
religious scholar referred to commonly as the Supreme Leader who,
according to the constitution, is accountable only to the Assembly
of Experts - a popularly elected 88-member body of clerics.
US-Iranian relations became strained when a group of Iranian
students seized the US Embassy in Tehran in November 1979 and held
embassy personnel hostage until mid-January 1981. The US cut off
diplomatic relations with Iran in April 1980. During the period
1980-88, Iran fought a bloody, indecisive war with Iraq that
eventually expanded into the Persian Gulf and led to clashes
between US Navy and Iranian military forces. Iran has been
designated a state sponsor of terrorism and was subject to US, UN,
and EU economic sanctions and export controls because of its
continued involvement in terrorism and concerns over possible
military dimensions of its nuclear program until Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) Implementation Day in 2016.
The US began gradually re-imposing sanctions on Iran after the US
withdrawal from JCPOA in May 2018.Following the election of reformer Hojjat ol-Eslam Mohammad
KHATAMI as president in 1997 and a reformist Majles (legislature)
in 2000, a campaign to foster political reform in response to
popular dissatisfaction was initiated. The movement floundered as
conservative politicians, supported by the Supreme Leader,
unelected institutions of authority like the Council of Guardians,
and the security services reversed and blocked reform measures
while increasing security repression. Starting with nationwide
municipal elections in 2003 and continuing through Majles elections
in 2004, conservatives reestablished control over Iran's elected
government institutions, which culminated with the August 2005
inauguration of hardliner Mahmud AHMADI-NEJAD as president. His
controversial reelection in June 2009 sparked nationwide protests
over allegations of electoral fraud, but the protests were quickly
suppressed. Deteriorating economic conditions due primarily to
government mismanagement and international sanctions prompted at
least two major economically based protests in July and October
2012, but Iran's internal security situation remained stable.
President AHMADI-NEJAD's independent streak angered regime
establishment figures, including the Supreme Leader, leading to
conservative opposition to his agenda for the last year of his
presidency, and an alienation of his political supporters. In June
2013, Iranians elected a centrist cleric Dr. Hasan Fereidun RUHANI
to the presidency. A longtime senior member in the regime, he made
promises of reforming society and Iran's foreign policy. In July
2015, Iran and the five permanent members, plus Germany (P5+1)
signed the JCPOA under which Iran agreed to restrictions on its
nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief; however, the US
reimposed sanctions in 2018 dealing a blow to RUHANI's legacy and
the Iranian economy. Negotiations to restore the deal started in
2021 and are ongoing. Iran held elections in February 2020 for the
Majles and the president in June 2021, resulting in a hardline and
conservative monopoly across the regime's elected and unelected
institutions. President Ebrahim RAISI is a hardline cleric with a
decades-long career in Iran's judiciary and has had limited foreign
policy and economic experience.</subsection>

note 1: adopted 1990; Iran has had six national
anthems; the first, entitled "Salam-e Shah" (Royal Salute) was in
use from 1873-1909; next came "Salamati-ye Dowlat-e Elliye-ye Iran"
(Salute of the Sublime State of Persia, 1909-1933); it was followed
by "Sorud-e melli" (The Imperial Anthem of Iran; 1933-1979), which
chronicled the exploits of the Pahlavi Dynasty; "Ey Iran" (Oh Iran)
functioned unofficially as the national anthem for a brief period
between the ouster of the Shah in 1979 and the early days of the
Islamic Republic in 1980; "Payandeh Bada Iran" (Long Live Iran) was
used between 1980 and 1990 during the time of Ayatollah
KHOMEINI<br/>

national anthem is unavailable since the US Navy Band does not

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Iran’s telecom
infrastructure has suffered from sanctions in recent years, which
prevented the import of equipment and devices and encouraged
widespread smuggling, with a consequent loss of tax revenue; to
address this, the government introduced a device registration
scheme, and bolstered the capacity for domestically manufactured
mobile phones; companies have invested in broadening the reach of
their LTE networks, which has increased network capacity and
improved the quality of mobile broadband services; the country is
also looking to 5G; the sector is still limited by low frequency
bands; the government is addressing this with plans to reallocate
the 3.5GHz band for 5G use; Iran is keen to grow its digital
economy; Iran offers significant opportunities for growth in the
telecoms sector; the country has one of the largest populations in
the Middle East, and there is a high proportion of youthful, tech
savvy users having considerable demand for both fixed and mobile
telecom services; companies are offering national roaming to
improve services in rural areas (2022)<br/>

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased

         <br/>
note 1: the Artesh Navy operates Iran’s larger
warships and operates in the Gulf of Oman, the Caspian Sea, and
deep waters in the region and beyond; the IRGC Navy has
responsibility for the closer-in Persian Gulf and Strait of
Hormuz<br/>
         <br/>
note 2: the Basij is a volunteer paramilitary
group under the IRGC with local organizations across the country,
which sometimes acts as an auxiliary law enforcement unit; it is
formally known as the Organization for the Mobilization of the
Oppressed; it is also known as the Popular Mobilization Army<br/>

      <subsection title="Military and security service personnel strengths">information varies; approximately 550-600,000 active armed
forces personnel; approximately 400,000 Islamic Republic of Iran
Regular Forces (350,000 Ground Forces; 18,000 Navy; 40,000 Air
Force/Air Defense Forces); approximately 150-190,000 Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps (100-150,000 Ground Forces; 20,000 Navy;
15,000 Aerospace Force; 5-15,000 Qods Force); estimated 90,000
active Basij Paramilitary Forces (2022)</subsection>
      <subsection title="Military equipment inventories and acquisitions">the Iranian military's inventory includes a mix of domestically
produced and mostly older foreign equipment largely of Chinese,
Russian, Soviet, and US origin (US equipment acquired prior to the
Islamic Revolution in 1979); Iran has also received some military
equipment from North Korea, including midget submarines and
ballistic missiles; Iran has a defense industry with the capacity
to develop, produce, support, and sustain air, land, missile, and
naval weapons programs (2022)</subsection>
      <subsection title="Military service age and obligation">18 years of age for men for compulsory military service; 16
years of age for volunteers; 17 years of age for Law Enforcement
Forces; 15 years of age for Basij Forces (Popular Mobilization
Army); conscript military service obligation is 18-24 months,
depending on the location of service (soldiers serving in places of
high security risk and deprived areas serve shorter terms); women
exempt from military service (2021)<br/>
         <br/>
note: as of 2019, approximately 80% of Artesh
ground forces personnel were conscripts, while Navy and Air/Air
Defense Force personnel were primarily volunteers; conscripts
reportedly comprised more than 50% of the IRGC</subsection>
      <subsection title="Military deployments">estimated to have up to 3,000 military personnel in Syria
(2022)<br/>
         <br/>
note: Iran has recruited, trained, and funded
thousands of Syrian and foreign fighters to support the ASAD regime
during the Syrian civil war</subsection>
      <subsection title="Military - note">the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) was formed in May
1979 in the immediate aftermath of Shah Mohammad Reza PAHLAVI’s
fall, as leftists, nationalists, and Islamists jockeyed for power;
while the interim prime minister controlled the government and
state institutions, such as the Army, followers of Ayatollah
Ruhollah KHOMEINI organized counterweights, including the IRGC, to
protect the Islamic revolution; the IRGC’s command structure
bypassed the elected president and went directly to KHOMEINI; the
Iran-Iraq War (1980–88) transformed the IRGC into more of a
conventional fighting force with its own ground, air, naval, and
special forces, plus control over Iran’s strategic missile and
rocket forces; as of 2022, the IRGC was a highly institutionalized
and parallel military force to Iran’s regular armed forces
(Artesh); it was heavily involved in internal security and had
significant influence in the political and economic spheres of
Iranian society, as well as Iran’s foreign policy; on the economic
front, it owned factories and corporations and subsidiaries in
banking, infrastructure, housing, airlines, tourism and other
sectors; its special operations forces, known as the Qods/Quds
Force, specialized in foreign missions and has provided advice,
funding, guidance, material support, training, and weapons to
militants in countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen,
as well as extremist groups, including HAMAS, Hizballah, Kata’ib
Hizballah, and Palestine Islamic Jihad (see <br/>Appendix
T for additional details on the IRGC and Qods Force); the Qods
Force also conducts intelligence and reconnaissance
operations <br/>
         <br/>
the Supreme Council for National Security (SCNS) is the senior-most
body for formulating Iran’s foreign and security policy; it is
formally chaired by the president, who also appoints the SCNS
secretary; its members include the speaker of the Majles, the head
of the judiciary, the chief of the Armed Forces General Staff
(chief of defense or CHOD), the commanders of the Artesh (regular
forces) and IRGC, and the ministers of defense, foreign affairs,
interior, and intelligence; the SCNS reports to the supreme leader;
the supreme leader is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces

      <subsection title="Maritime threats">the Maritime Administration of the US Department of
Transportation has issued a Maritime Advisory (2022-003 Persian
Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, Gulf of Oman, Arabian Sea, Red Sea-Threats
to US and International Shipping from Iran) effective 28 February
2022, which states in part that "heightened military activities and
increased political tensions in this region continue to present
risk to commercial shipping...there is a continued possibility that
Iran and/or its regional proxies could take actions against US and
partner interests in the region;" Coalition Task Force (CTF)
Sentinel has been established to provide escorts for commercial
shipping transiting the Persian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, and Gulf of

      <subsection title="Trafficking in persons">tier rating: Tier 3 — Iran does not fully meet
the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not
making significant efforts to do so; therefore, Iran remained in
Tier 3; the government continued a policy of recruiting and using
child soldiers, government officials perpetrated sex trafficking of
adults and children and continued trafficking both in Iran and
overseas; the government continued to force or coerce children and
adults to fight for Iranian-led militias operating in Syria and
provided financial support to militias fighting in armed conflicts
in the region using child soldiers; authorities failed to identify
and protect trafficking victims among vulnerable populations; law
enforcement treated trafficking victims as criminals, facing severe
punishment or death for unlawful acts traffickers compelled them to
commit (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
trafficking profile: Iran is a presumed source,
transit, and destination country for men, women, and children
subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor; Iranian and Afghan
boys and girls are forced into prostitution domestically; Iranian
women are subjected to sex trafficking in Iran, Pakistan, the
Persian Gulf, and Europe; Azerbaijani women and children are also
sexually exploited in Iran; Afghan migrants and refugees and
Pakistani men and women are subjected to conditions of forced labor
in Iran; NGO reports indicate that criminal organizations play a
significant role in human trafficking in Iran</subsection>
