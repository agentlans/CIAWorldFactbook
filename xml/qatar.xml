   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Ruled by the Al Thani family since the mid-1800s, Qatar within
the last 60 years transformed itself from a poor British
protectorate noted mainly for pearling into an independent state
with significant oil and natural gas revenues. Former Amir HAMAD
bin Khalifa Al Thani, who overthrew his father in a bloodless coup
in 1995, ushered in wide-sweeping political and media reforms,
unprecedented economic investment, and a growing Qatari regional
leadership role, in part through the creation of the pan-Arab
satellite news network Al-Jazeera and Qatar's mediation of some
regional conflicts. In the 2000s, Qatar resolved its longstanding
border disputes with both Bahrain and Saudi Arabia and by 2007 had
attained the highest per capita income in the world. Qatar did not
experience domestic unrest or violence like that seen in other Near
Eastern and North African countries in 2011, due in part to its
immense wealth and patronage network. In mid-2013, HAMAD peacefully
abdicated, transferring power to his son, the current Amir TAMIM
bin Hamad. TAMIM is popular with the Qatari public, for his role in
shepherding the country through an economic embargo by some other
regional countries, for his efforts to improve the country's
healthcare and education systems, and for his expansion of the
country's infrastructure in anticipation of Doha's hosting of the
2022 FIFA Men’s World Cup. </subsection>

mature telecom sector which has been able to absorb the additional
data demands made on it during the pandemic; mobile services based
on LTE are universally available to migrate to 5G; in combination
with a strong fiber rollout, the country is aiming to provide
gigabit services nationally; 5G services are largely based on
3.5GHz spectrum made available following an auction in early 2019

Es'hailSat 1 and 2 (2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
