   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The huge delta region formed at the confluence of the Ganges and
Brahmaputra River systems - now referred to as Bangladesh - was a
loosely incorporated outpost of various empires centered on the
Gangetic plain for much of the first millennium A.D. Muslim
conversions and settlement in the region began in the 10th century,
primarily from Arab and Persian traders and preachers. Europeans
established trading posts in the area in the 16th century.
Eventually the area known as Bengal, primarily Hindu in the western
section and mostly Muslim in the eastern half, became part of
British India. Partition in 1947 resulted in an eastern wing of
Pakistan in the Muslim-majority area, which became East Pakistan.
Calls for greater autonomy and animosity between the eastern and
western wings of Pakistan led to a Bengali independence movement.
That movement, led by the Awami League (AL) and supported by India,
won the independence war for Bangladesh in 1971.The post-independence AL government faced daunting challenges
and in 1975 it was overthrown by the military, triggering a series
of military coups that resulted in a military-backed government and
subsequent creation of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in
1978. That government also ended in a coup in 1981, followed by
military-backed rule until democratic elections occurred in 1991.
The BNP and AL have alternated in power since 1991, with the
exception of a military-backed, emergency caretaker regime that
suspended parliamentary elections planned for January 2007 in an
effort to reform the political system and root out corruption. That
government returned the country to fully democratic rule in
December 2008 with the election of the AL and Prime Minister Sheikh
HASINA. In January 2014, the incumbent AL won the national election
by an overwhelming majority after the BNP boycotted the election,
which extended HASINA's term as prime minister. In December 2018,
HASINA secured a third consecutive term (fourth overall) with the
AL coalition securing 96% of available seats, amid widespread
claims of election irregularities. With the help of international
development assistance, Bangladesh has reduced the poverty rate
from over half of the population to less than a third, achieved
Millennium Development Goals for maternal and child health, and
made great progress in food security since independence. The
economy has grown at an annual average of about 6% for the last two
decades. In 2021 the UN approved a resolution to allow Bangladesh
to officially graduate from least-developed-country (LDC) status in
2026, based on World Bank criteria.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">Bangladesh’s economic resurgence over the last decade took a battering in 2020 and 2021 as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic; the country had been on track to move off the United Nation’s Least Developed Countries list by 2026, however the crisis may have pushed that back a few years; the telecommunications sector experienced a set of challenges, with mobile data usage exploding at the same time as many consumers were being forced to curb their spending in other areas; the demand on data grew so large and so rapidly that Bangladesh came close to running out of bandwidth; at the start of 2020, Bangladesh was consuming around 900Gb/s on average, well below the 2,642GB/s capacity of its submarine cables; this ballooned to over 2,300Gb/s during the pandemic; Bangladesh was looking forward to adding 7,200Gb/s capacity when the SEA-ME-WE-6 submarine cable goes into service in mid-2024, but the sudden upsurge in downloads is forcing state-run company Bangladesh Submarine Cable Company Limited (BSCCL) to scramble to find alternatives before the country’s internet supply is maxed out; the increased demand during the Covid-19 crisis also put pressure on the country’s existing mobile networks, already under strain as a result of strong growth in the mobile broadband market coupled with significant untapped potential for mobile services in general across the country; this led to premium prices being paid at auction for spectrum in the 1800MHz and 2100MHz bands, most of which will be used to enhance and expand LTE services; a 5G spectrum auction had been anticipated for 2020, but low interest from the MNOs in going down that path when there are still so many areas waiting for LTE access means that 5G  will likely be deferred until 2023 (2021)</note>
         <note title="domestic">fixed-line teledensity remains less than 1 per 100 persons; mobile-cellular telephone subscribership has been increasing rapidly and now exceeds 107 per 100 persons; mobile subscriber growth is anticipated over the next five years to 2023 (2021)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>
