   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">As Europe's largest economy and second most populous nation
(after Russia), Germany is a key member of the continent's
economic, political, and defense organizations. European power
struggles immersed Germany in two devastating world wars in the
first half of the 20th century and left the country occupied by the
victorious Allied powers of the US, UK, France, and the Soviet
Union in 1945. With the advent of the Cold War, two German states
were formed in 1949: the western Federal Republic of Germany (FRG)
and the eastern German Democratic Republic (GDR). The democratic
FRG embedded itself in key western economic and security
organizations, the EC (now the EU) and NATO, while the communist
GDR was on the front line of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The
decline of the USSR and the end of the Cold War allowed for German
reunification in 1990. Since then, Germany has expended
considerable funds to bring eastern productivity and wages up to
western standards. In January 1999, Germany and 10 other EU
countries introduced a common European exchange currency, the
euro.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Legislative branch">description: bicameral Parliament or Parlament
consists of:<br/>
Federal Council or Bundesrat (69 seats statutory, 71 current;
members appointed by each of the 16 state governments)<br/>
Federal Diet or Bundestag (736 seats statutory, 736 for the 2021-25
term - total seats can vary each electoral term; currently includes
4 seats for independent members; approximately one-half of members
directly elected in multi-seat constituencies by proportional
representation vote and approximately one-half directly elected in
single-seat constituencies by simple majority vote; members' terms
depend upon the states they represent)<br/>
         <br/>
elections:<br/>
Bundesrat - none; determined by the composition of the state-level
governments; the composition of the Bundesrat has the potential to
change any time one of the 16 states holds an election<br/>
Bundestag - last held on 26 September 2021 (next to be held in
September 2025 at the latest); almost all postwar German
governments have been coalitions<br/>
         <br/>
election results:<br/>
Bundesrat - composition - men 46, women 23, percent of women
33.3%<br/>
Bundestag - percent of vote by party - SPD 28%, CDU/CSU 26.8%,
Alliance '90/Greens 16%, FDP 12.5%, AfD 11%, The Left 5.3%, other
.04%; seats by party - SPD 206, CDU/CSU 197, Alliance '90/Greens
118, FDP 92, AfD 81, The Left 39, other 3; composition - men 479,
women 257, percent of women 34.9%; note - total Parliament percent
of women 34.8%<br/>
         <br/>
note - due to Germany's recognition of the concepts of "overhang"
(when a party's share of the nationwide votes would entitle it to
fewer seats than the number of individual constituency seats won in
an election under Germany's mixed member proportional system) and
"leveling" (whereby additional seats are elected to supplement the
members directly elected by each constituency in order to ensure
that each party's share of the total seats is roughly proportional
to the party's overall shares of votes at the national level), the
20th Bundestag is the largest to date</subsection>
      <subsection title="Judicial branch">highest court(s): Federal Court of Justice
(court consists of 127 judges, including the court president, vice
presidents, presiding judges, other judges and organized into 25
Senates subdivided into 12 civil panels, 5 criminal panels, and 8
special panels); Federal Constitutional Court or
Bundesverfassungsgericht (consists of 2 Senates each subdivided
into 3 chambers, each with a chairman and 8 members)<br/>
         <br/>
judge selection and term of office: Federal Court
of Justice judges selected by the Judges Election Committee, which
consists of the Secretaries of Justice from each of the 16
federated states and 16 members appointed by the Federal
Parliament; judges appointed by the president; judges serve until
mandatory retirement at age 65; Federal Constitutional Court judges
- one-half elected by the House of Representatives and one-half by
the Senate; judges appointed for 12-year terms with mandatory
retirement at age 68<br/>
         <br/>
subordinate courts: Federal Administrative Court;
Federal Finance Court; Federal Labor Court; Federal Social Court;
each of the 16 federated states or Land has its own constitutional
court and a hierarchy of ordinary (civil, criminal, family) and
specialized (administrative, finance, labor, social) courts; two
English-speaking commercial courts opened in late 2020 in the state
of Baden-Wuerttemberg - English-speaking Stuttgart Commercial Court

connection to the March 1848 liberal revolution; following
appropriation by the Nazis of the first verse, specifically the

above all) to promote nationalism, it was banned after 1945; in

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
