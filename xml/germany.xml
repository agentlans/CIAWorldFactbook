   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">As Europe's largest economy and second most populous nation
(after Russia), Germany is a key member of the continent's
economic, political, and defense organizations. European power
struggles immersed Germany in two devastating world wars in the
first half of the 20th century and left the country occupied by the
victorious Allied powers of the US, UK, France, and the Soviet
Union in 1945. With the advent of the Cold War, two German states
were formed in 1949: the western Federal Republic of Germany (FRG)
and the eastern German Democratic Republic (GDR). The democratic
FRG embedded itself in key western economic and security
organizations, the EC (now the EU) and NATO, while the communist
GDR was on the front line of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The
decline of the USSR and the end of the Cold War allowed for German
reunification in 1990. Since then, Germany has expended
considerable funds to bring eastern productivity and wages up to
western standards. In January 1999, Germany and 10 other EU
countries introduced a common European exchange currency, the
euro.</subsection>
