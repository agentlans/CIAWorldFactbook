   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Philippine Islands became a Spanish colony during the 16th
century; they were ceded to the US in 1898 following the
Spanish-American War. In 1935 the Philippines became a
self-governing commonwealth. Manuel QUEZON was elected president
and was tasked with preparing the country for independence after a
10-year transition. In 1942 the islands fell under Japanese
occupation during World War II, and US forces and Filipinos fought
together during 1944-45 to regain control. On 4 July 1946 the
Republic of the Philippines attained its independence. A 21-year
rule by Ferdinand MARCOS ended in 1986, when a "people power"
movement in Manila ("EDSA 1") forced him into exile and installed
Corazon AQUINO as president. Her presidency was hampered by several
coup attempts that prevented a return to full political stability
and economic development. Fidel RAMOS was elected president in
1992. His administration was marked by increased stability and by
progress on economic reforms. In 1992, the US closed its last
military bases on the islands. Joseph ESTRADA was elected president
in 1998. He was succeeded by his vice-president, Gloria
MACAPAGAL-ARROYO, in January 2001 after ESTRADA's stormy
impeachment trial on corruption charges broke down and another
"people power" movement ("EDSA 2") demanded his resignation.
MACAPAGAL-ARROYO was elected to a six-year term as president in May
2004. Her presidency was marred by several corruption allegations,
but the Philippine economy was one of the few to avoid contraction
following the 2008 global financial crisis, expanding each year of
her administration. Benigno AQUINO III was elected to a six-year
term as president in May 2010 and was succeeded by Rodrigo DUTERTE
in May 2016.The Philippine Government faces threats from several groups,
some of which are on the US Government's Foreign Terrorist
Organization list. Manila has waged a decades-long struggle against
ethnic Moro insurgencies in the southern Philippines, which led to
a peace accord with the Moro National Liberation Front and a
separate agreement with a break away faction, the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front. The decades-long Maoist-inspired New People's
Army insurgency also operates through much of the country. In 2017,
Philippine armed forces battled an ISIS-East Asia siege in Marawi
City, driving DUTERTE to declare martial law in the region. The
Philippines faces increased tension with China over disputed
territorial and maritime claims in the South China Sea.</subsection>

was reported as having 7,107 islands; in 2016, the national mapping
authority reported that hundreds of new islands had been discovered
and increased the number of islands to 7,641 - though not all of
the new islands have been verified; the country is favorably
located in relation to many of Southeast Asia's main water bodies:
the South China Sea, Philippine Sea, Sulu Sea, Celebes Sea, and
Luzon Straitnote 2: Philippines is one of the countries
along the Ring of Fire, a belt of active volcanoes and earthquake
epicenters bordering the Pacific Ocean; up to 90% of the world's
earthquakes and some 75% of the world's volcanoes occur within the
Ring of Firenote 3: the Philippines sits astride the
Pacific typhoon belt and an average of 9 typhoons make landfall on
the islands each year - with about 5 of these being destructive;
the country is the most exposed in the world to tropical storms</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">The Philippines is an ethnically diverse country that is in the
early stages of demographic transition.  Its fertility rate
has dropped steadily since the 1950s.  The decline was more
rapid after the introduction of a national population program in
the 1970s in large part due to the increased use of modern
contraceptive methods, but fertility has decreased more slowly in
recent years.  The country’s total fertility rate (TFR) – the
average number of births per woman – dropped below 5 in the 1980s,
below 4 in the 1990s, and below 3 in the 2010s.  TFR continues
to be above replacement level at 2.9 and even higher among the
poor, rural residents, and the less-educated.  Significant
reasons for elevated TFR are the desire for more than two children,
in part because children are a means of financial assistance and
security for parents as they age, particularly among the poor.The Philippines are the source of one of the world’s largest
emigrant populations, much of which consists of legal temporary
workers known as Overseas Foreign Workers or OFWs.  As of
2019, there were 2.2 million OFWs.  They work in a wide array
of fields, most frequently in services (such as caregivers and
domestic work), skilled trades, and construction but also in
professional fields, including nursing and engineering.  OFWs
most often migrate to Middle Eastern countries, but other popular
destinations include Hong Kong, China, and Singapore, as well as
employment on ships.  Filipino seafarers make up 35-40% of the
world’s seafarers, as of 2014.   Women OFWs, who work
primarily in domestic services and entertainment, have outnumbered
men since 1992. Migration and remittances have been a feature of Philippine
culture for decades.  The government has encouraged and
facilitated emigration, regulating recruitment agencies and
adopting legislation to protect the rights of migrant
workers.  Filipinos began emigrating to the US and Hawaii
early in the 20th century.  In 1934, US legislation
limited Filipinos to 50 visas per year except during labor
shortages, causing emigration to plummet.  It was not until
the 1960s, when the US and other destination countries – Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand – loosened their immigration policies,
that Filipino emigration expanded and diversified.  The
government implemented an overseas employment program in the 1970s,
promoting Filipino labor to Gulf countries needing more workers for
their oil industries.  Filipino emigration increased
rapidly.  The government had intended for international
migration to be temporary, but a lack of jobs and poor wages
domestically, the ongoing demand for workers in the Gulf countries,
and new labor markets in Asia continue to spur Philippine
emigration.</subsection>

complete the roll outs as per the original schedule; the major
telecom operators had mixed financial results for the past year;
overall, the number of mobile subscribers is expected to grow to
153 million by the end of 2021, with the penetration rate
approaching 144%; the government remains keen, and committed, to
seeing strong competition, growth, and service excellence in the
telecom sector, so there is likely to be continued support
(financially as well as through legislation such as enabling mobile
tower sharing and number portability) to ensure that the sector
remains viable for emerging players; the mobile sector will remain
the Philippines’ primary market for telecommunications well into
the future; the unique terrain and resulting challenges associated
with accessing remote parts of the archipelago means that in many
areas fixed networks are neither cost-effective nor logistically
viable; the bulk of telecoms investment over the coming years will
continue to be in 5G and 5G-enabled LTE networks; coverage of LTE
and 5G networks extends to over 95% of the population, and for the
vast majority of people mobile will likely remain their only
platform for telecom services (2021)<br/>

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

note: as of 2020, women made up about 6% of the
active military; women were allowed to enter the Philippine
Military Academy and train as combat soldiers in 1993</subsection>
      <subsection title="Military - note">the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) were formally
organized during the American colonial period as the Philippine
Army; they were established by the National Defense Act of 1935 and
were comprised of both Filipinos and Americans<br/>
         <br/>
the US and Philippines agreed to a mutual defense treaty in 1951;
in 2014, the two governments signed an Enhanced Defense Cooperation
Agreement (EDCA) that established new parameters for military
cooperation; under the EDCA, the Philippine Government may grant US
troops access to Philippine military bases on a rotational basis
“for security cooperation exercises, joint and combined military
training activities, and humanitarian assistance and disaster
relief activities”; the Philippines has Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA)
status with the US; MNNA is a designation under US law that
provides foreign partners with certain benefits in the areas of
defense trade and security cooperation; while MNNA status provides
military and economic privileges, it does not entail any security
commitments<br/>
         <br/>
as of 2022, the AFP's primary air and ground operational focus was
on internal security duties, particularly in the south, where
several separatist Islamic insurgent and terrorist groups operated
and up to 60% of the armed forces were deployed; additional combat
operations were being conducted against the Communist Peoples
Party/New People’s Army, which was active mostly on Luzon, the
Visayas, and areas of Mindanao; prior to a peace deal in 2014, the
AFP fought a decades-long conflict against the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF), a separatist organization based mostly on
the island of Mindanao; the MILF's armed wing, the Bangsamoro
Islamic Armed Forces (BIAF), had up to 40,000 fighters under
arms<br/>
         <br/>
in addition to its typical roles of patrolling and defending the
country's maritime claims, the Navy conducts interdiction
operations against terrorist, insurgent, and criminal groups around
the southern islands; in 2017, the Philippines began conducting
joint maritime patrols with Indonesia and Malaysia to counter
regional terrorist activities, particularly in the Sulu Sea; the
Philippine Marine Corps assists the Army in counterinsurgency
operations<br/>
         <br/>
the Philippines National Police (PNP) also has an active role in
counterinsurgency and counter-terrorism operations alongside the
AFP, particularly the Special Action Force, a PNP commando unit
that specializes in urban counter-terrorism operations (2022)</subsection>
      <subsection title="Maritime threats">the International Maritime Bureau reports the territorial waters
of littoral states and offshore waters in the South China Sea as
high risk for piracy and armed robbery against ships; an emerging
threat area lies in the Celebes and Sulu Seas between the
Philippines and Malaysia where 11 ships were attacked in 2021;
numerous commercial vessels have been attacked and hijacked both at
anchor and while underway; hijacked vessels are often disguised and
cargoes stolen</subsection>

China, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam; the 2002 "Declaration on the
Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea," has eased tensions in
the Spratly Islands but falls short of a legally binding "code of
conduct" desired by several of the disputants; in March 2005, the
national oil companies of China, the Philippines, and Vietnam
signed a joint accord to conduct marine seismic activities in the
Spratly IslandsPhilippines-Malaysia: Philippines retains a dormant
claim to Malaysia's Sabah State in northern Borneo based on the
Sultanate of Sulu's granting the Philippines Government power of
