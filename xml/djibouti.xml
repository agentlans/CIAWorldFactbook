   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The region of present-day Djibouti was the site of the medieval
Ifat and Adal Sultanates. In the late 19th century, treaties signed
by the Afar sultans with the French allowed the latter to establish
the colony of French Somaliland in 1862. The French signed
additional treaties with the ethnic Somali in 1885.</subsection>

Ethiopian, and Italian)</subsection>

      <subsection title="Religions">Sunni Muslim 94% (nearly all Djiboutians), other 6% (mainly

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Djibouti is a poor, predominantly urban country, characterized
by high rates of illiteracy, unemployment, and childhood
malnutrition. Approximately 70% of the population lives in cities
and towns (predominantly in the capital, Djibouti). The rural
population subsists primarily on nomadic herding. Prone to droughts
and floods, the country has few natural resources and must import
more than 80% of its food from neighboring countries or Europe.
Health care, particularly outside the capital, is limited by poor
infrastructure, shortages of equipment and supplies, and a lack of
qualified personnel. More than a third of health care recipients
are migrants because the services are still better than those
available in their neighboring home countries. The nearly universal
practice of female genital cutting reflects Djibouti’s lack of
gender equality and is a major contributor to obstetrical
complications and its high rates of maternal and infant mortality.
A 1995 law prohibiting the practice has never been enforced.Because of its political stability and its strategic location at
the confluence of East Africa and the Gulf States along the Gulf of
Aden and the Red Sea, Djibouti is a key transit point for migrants
and asylum seekers heading for the Gulf States and beyond. Each
year some 100,000 people, mainly Ethiopians and some Somalis,
journey through Djibouti, usually to the port of Obock, to attempt
a dangerous sea crossing to Yemen. However, with the escalation of
the ongoing Yemen conflict, Yemenis began fleeing to Djibouti in
March 2015, with almost 20,000 arriving by August 2017. Most
Yemenis remain unregistered and head for Djibouti City rather than
seeking asylum at one of Djibouti’s three spartan refugee camps.
Djibouti has been hosting refugees and asylum seekers,
predominantly Somalis and lesser numbers of Ethiopians and
Eritreans, at camps for 20 years, despite lacking potable water,
food shortages, and unemployment.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">Djibouti remains one of the last bastions where the national telco has a monopoly on all telecom services, including fixed lines, mobile, internet, and broadband; despite the country benefiting from its location as a hub for international submarine cables, prices for telecom services remain relatively high, and out of reach for a number of customers, weighing on market advancement; the Djibouti government is aiming to sell a minority stake in the incumbent telco (retaining some control of decisions) while securing the financial backing and the management acumen of a foreign operator; this is part of a larger plan to modernize the country’s economy more generally; the state expects to conduct a sale of up to 40% of the company to an international investor by the end 2022 (2022)</note>
         <note title="domestic">about 4 per 100 fixed-line teledensity and nearly 44 per 100 mobile-cellular; Djibouti Telecom (DT) is the sole provider of telecommunications services and utilizes mostly a microwave radio relay network; fiber-optic cable is installed in the capital; rural areas connected via wireless local loop radio systems; mobile cellular coverage is primarily limited to the area in and around Djibouti city (2020)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>

incidents, the IMB PRC warned that Somali pirates continued to
possess the capacity to carry out attacks in the Somali basin and
wider Indian Ocean; in particular, the report warned that, "Masters
and crew must remain vigilant and cautious when transiting these
waters."; the presence of several naval task forces in the Gulf of
Aden and additional anti-piracy measures on the part of ship
operators, including the use of on-board armed security teams,
contributed to the drop in incidents; the EU naval mission,
Operation ATALANTA, continues its operations in the Gulf of Aden
and Indian Ocean through 2022; naval units from China, India,
Japan, Pakistan, South Korea, the US, and other countries also
operate in conjunction with EU forces; China has established a base
in Djibouti to support its deployed naval units in the Horn of

issues along its border with neighbors such as Somalia and Eritrea,
the Ethiopia-Djibouti relationship has been relatively harmonious;
diplomatic relations between the two countries were initially
established in 1984; historically, there is co-ownership of the
Addis Ababa-Djibout railways and acts as a symbol of the healthy
bi-lateral partnership between both Ethiopia and Djibouti; in 1991
a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation was signed by the two
countries; Ethiopia uses the Port of Djibouti as a major hub for
export and import of goods since 1998; after establishing
independence, there have been no major disputes along this
border.</subsection>
