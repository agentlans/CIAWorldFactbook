      <subsection title="Background">Several Indigenous groups, principally belonging to the Guarani
language family, inhabited the area of modern Paraguay before the
arrival of the Spanish in the early 16th century, when
the territory was incorporated into the Viceroyalty of Peru.
Paraguay achieved its independence from Spain in 1811 with the help
of neighboring states. In the aftermath of independence, a series
of military dictators ruled the country until 1870. During the
disastrous War of the Triple Alliance (1864-70) - fought against
Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay - Paraguay lost two thirds of its
adult males and much of its territory. The country stagnated
economically for the next half century and experienced a tumultuous
series of political regimes. Following the Chaco War of 1932-35
with Bolivia, Paraguay gained a large part of the Chaco lowland
region. The 35-year military dictatorship of Alfredo STROESSNER
ended in 1989, and Paraguay has held relatively free and regular
presidential elections since the country's return to democracy.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Paraguay falls below the Latin American average in several
socioeconomic categories, including immunization rates, potable
water, sanitation, and secondary school enrollment, and has greater
rates of income inequality and child and maternal mortality.
Paraguay's poverty rate has declined in recent years but remains
high, especially in rural areas, with more than a third of the
population below the poverty line. However, the well-being of the
poor in many regions has improved in terms of housing quality and
access to clean water, telephone service, and electricity. The
fertility rate continues to drop, declining sharply from an average
4.3 births per woman in the late 1990s to about 2 in 2013, as a
result of the greater educational attainment of women, increased
use of contraception, and a desire for smaller families among young
women.Paraguay is a country of emigration; it has not attracted large
numbers of immigrants because of political instability, civil wars,
years of dictatorship, and the greater appeal of neighboring
countries. Paraguay first tried to encourage immigration in 1870 in
order to rebound from the heavy death toll it suffered during the
War of the Triple Alliance, but it received few European and Middle
Eastern immigrants. In the 20th century, limited numbers of
immigrants arrived from Lebanon, Japan, South Korea, and China, as
well as Mennonites from Canada, Russia, and Mexico. Large flows of
Brazilian immigrants have been arriving since the 1960s, mainly to
work in agriculture. Paraguayans continue to emigrate to Argentina,
Brazil, Uruguay, the United States, Italy, Spain, and France.</subsection>

an emblem centered in the white band; unusual flag in that the
emblem is different on each side; the obverse (hoist side at the
left) bears the national coat of arms (a yellow five-pointed star
within a green wreath capped by the words REPUBLICA DEL PARAGUAY,
all within two circles); the reverse (hoist side at the right)
bears a circular seal of the treasury (a yellow lion below a red
Cap of Liberty and the words PAZ Y JUSTICIA (Peace and Justice));
red symbolizes bravery and patriotism, white represents integrity
and peace, and blue denotes liberty and generosity<br/>

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
