   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Trucial States of the Persian Gulf coast granted the UK
control of their defense and foreign affairs in 19th century
treaties. In 1971, six of these states - Abu Dhabi, 'Ajman, Al
Fujayrah, Ash Shariqah, Dubayy, and Umm al Qaywayn - merged to form
the United Arab Emirates (UAE). They were joined in 1972 by Ra's al
Khaymah. The UAE's per capita GDP is on par with those of leading
West European nations. For more than three decades, oil and global
finance drove the UAE's economy. In 2008-09, the confluence of
falling oil prices, collapsing real estate prices, and the
international banking crisis hit the UAE especially hard. The UAE
did not experience the "Arab Spring" unrest seen elsewhere in the
Middle East in 2010-11, partly because of the government's
multi-year, $1.6-billion infrastructure investment plan for the
poorer northern emirates, and its aggressive pursuit of advocates
of political reform. The UAE in recent years has played a growing
role in regional affairs. In addition to donating billions of
dollars in economic aid to help stabilize Egypt, the UAE was one of
the first countries to join the Defeat-ISIS coalition, and to
participate as a key partner in a Saudi-led military campaign in
Yemen. On 15 September 2020, the UAE and Bahrain signed a peace
agreement (the Abraham Accords) with Israel – brokered by the US –
in Washington DC. The UAE and Bahrain thus became the third and
fourth Middle Eastern countries, along with Egypt and Jordan, to
recognize Israel.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: the UAE has a strong mobile
market; while the 5G penetration rate is the second highest
globally after China; this has underpinned growth in the mobile
broadband sector, and has enabled the strong development in the
take-up of rich content and applications, as well as m-commerce; to
help increase the capacity of 5G networks in coming years, and so
keep up with data demand, the government has allowed for the GSM
networks to be closed down and for spectrum and other assets to be
re-purposed for 5G by the end of 2022; the fixed-broadband network
in the UAE is dominated by fiber, with DSL having a minor and
declining presence; this focus on a fully fiber infrastructure has
also facilitated growth in e-commerce, and has supported the
government’s long-term aim of transitioning the economy from its
dependence on oil to being knowledge-based and supported by digital
services; the country stands to benefit from having signed the
Abraham Accord Declaration with Israel, which aims to normalize
relations between the two countries; such benefits can be seen in
the agreement to enable local ISPs to access Bezeq International’s
submarine cable infrastructure, and so improve direct connectivity
to Europe, South East Asia, and Africa; the UAE’s ISPs can also
access Bezeq International’s data center in Tel Aviv, improving
internet services (2022)<br/>

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
