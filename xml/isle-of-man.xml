   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Part of the Norwegian Kingdom of the Hebrides until the 13th
century when it was ceded to Scotland, the isle came under the
British crown in 1765. Current concerns include reviving the almost
extinct Manx Gaelic language. The Isle of Man is a British Crown
dependency, which makes it a self-governing possession of the
British Crown that is not part of the UK. The UK Government,
however, remains constitutionally responsible for its defense and
international representation.</subsection>
