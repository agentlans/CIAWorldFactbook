   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Poland's history as a state began near the middle of the 10th
century. By the mid-16th century, the Polish-Lithuanian
Commonwealth ruled a vast tract of land in Central and Eastern
Europe. During the 18th century, internal disorders weakened the
nation, and in a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795,
Russia, Prussia, and Austria partitioned Poland among themselves.
Poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by
Germany and the Soviet Union in World War II. It became a Soviet
satellite state following the war. Labor turmoil in 1980 led to the
formation of the independent trade union "Solidarity" that over
time became a political force with over 10 million members. Free
elections in 1989 and 1990 won Solidarity control of the parliament
and the presidency, bringing the communist era to a close. A "shock
therapy" program during the early 1990s enabled the country to
transform its economy into one of the most robust in Central
Europe. Poland joined NATO in 1999 and the EU in 2004.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">the liberalized telecom market has seen considerable development in the broadband and mobile sectors; the regulatory environment has encouraged market competition, partly by encouraging operators to secure spectrum and also by ensuring access to cable and fiber infrastructure; the mobile market in recent years has been characterized by the rapid extension of LTE networks and the development of mobile data services based on newly released and re-farmed spectrum; the regulator’s attempts to auction spectrum in a range of bands has been delayed, with spectrum in the 5G-suitable 3.4-3.8GHz range having been suspended to later in 2021 as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak and legislative changes (2021)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>
