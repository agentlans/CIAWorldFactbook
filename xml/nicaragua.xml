   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Pacific coast of Nicaragua was settled as a Spanish colony
from Panama in the early 16th century. Independence from Spain was
declared in 1821 and the country became an independent republic in
1838. Britain occupied the Caribbean Coast in the first half of the
19th century, but gradually ceded control of the region in
subsequent decades. Violent opposition to governmental manipulation
and corruption spread to all classes by 1978 and resulted in a
short-lived civil war that brought a civic-military coalition,
spearheaded by the Marxist Sandinista guerrillas led by Daniel
ORTEGA Saavedra to power in 1979. Nicaraguan aid to leftist rebels
in El Salvador prompted the US to sponsor anti-Sandinista contra
guerrillas through much of the 1980s. After losing free and fair
elections in 1990, 1996, and 2001, former Sandinista President
Daniel ORTEGA was elected president in 2006, 2011, 2016, and most
recently in 2021. Municipal, regional, and national-level elections
since 2008 have been marred by widespread irregularities.
Democratic institutions have weakened under the ORTEGA regime as
the president has garnered full control over all branches of
government, especially after cracking down on a nationwide
pro-democracy protest movement in 2018. In the lead-up to the 2021
presidential election, authorities arrested over 40 individuals
linked to the political opposition, including presidential
candidates, private sector leaders, NGO workers, human rights
defenders, and journalists. Only five lesser-known presidential
candidates of mostly small parties allied to ORTEGA's Sandinistas
were allowed to run against ORTEGA in the November 2021
election.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Despite being one of the poorest countries in Latin America,
Nicaragua has improved its access to potable water and sanitation
and has ameliorated its life expectancy, infant and child
mortality, and immunization rates. However, income distribution is
very uneven, and the poor, agriculturalists, and indigenous people
continue to have less access to healthcare services. Nicaragua's
total fertility rate has fallen from around 6 children per woman in
1980 to below replacement level today, but the high birth rate
among adolescents perpetuates a cycle of poverty and low
educational attainment.Nicaraguans emigrate primarily to Costa Rica and to a lesser
extent the United States. Nicaraguan men have been migrating
seasonally to Costa Rica to harvest bananas and coffee since the
early 20th century. Political turmoil, civil war, and natural
disasters from the 1970s through the 1990s dramatically increased
the flow of refugees and permanent migrants seeking jobs, higher
wages, and better social and healthcare benefits. Since 2000,
Nicaraguan emigration to Costa Rica has slowed and stabilized.
Today roughly 300,000 Nicaraguans are permanent residents of Costa
Rica - about 75% of the foreign population - and thousands more
migrate seasonally for work, many illegally.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">Nicaragua’s telecoms market has mirrored the country’s poor economic achievements, with fixed-line teledensity and mobile penetration also being the lowest in Central America; the fixed line broadband market remains nascent, with population penetration below 4%; most internet users are concentrated in the largest cities, given that rural and marginal areas lack access to the most basic telecom infrastructure; internet cafés provide public access to internet and email services, but these also tend to be restricted to the larger population centers; to address poor infrastructure, the World Bank has funded a project aimed at improving connectivity via a national fiber broadband network; there are separate schemes to improve broadband in eastern regions and provide links to Caribbean submarine cables; the number of mobile subscribers overtook the number of fixed lines in early 2002, and the mobile sector now accounts for most lines in service (2021)</note>
         <note title="domestic">since privatization, access to fixed-line and mobile-cellular services has improved; fixed-line teledensity roughly 3 per 100 persons; mobile-cellular telephone subscribership has increased to roughly 90 per 100 persons (2020)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>
