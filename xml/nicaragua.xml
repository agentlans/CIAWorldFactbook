   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Pacific coast of Nicaragua was settled as a Spanish colony
from Panama in the early 16th century. Independence from Spain was
declared in 1821 and the country became an independent republic in
1838. Britain occupied the Caribbean Coast in the first half of the
19th century, but gradually ceded control of the region in
subsequent decades. Violent opposition to governmental manipulation
and corruption spread to all classes by 1978 and resulted in a
short-lived civil war that brought a civic-military coalition,
spearheaded by the Marxist Sandinista guerrillas led by Daniel
ORTEGA Saavedra to power in 1979. Nicaraguan aid to leftist rebels
in El Salvador prompted the US to sponsor anti-Sandinista contra
guerrillas through much of the 1980s. After losing free and fair
elections in 1990, 1996, and 2001, former Sandinista President
Daniel ORTEGA was elected president in 2006, 2011, 2016, and most
recently in 2021. Municipal, regional, and national-level elections
since 2008 have been marred by widespread irregularities.
Democratic institutions have weakened under the ORTEGA regime as
the president has garnered full control over all branches of
government, especially after cracking down on a nationwide
pro-democracy protest movement in 2018. In the lead-up to the 2021
presidential election, authorities arrested over 40 individuals
linked to the political opposition, including presidential
candidates, private sector leaders, NGO workers, human rights
defenders, and journalists. Only five lesser-known presidential
candidates of mostly small parties allied to ORTEGA's Sandinistas
were allowed to run against ORTEGA in the November 2021
election.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Despite being one of the poorest countries in Latin America,
Nicaragua has improved its access to potable water and sanitation
and has ameliorated its life expectancy, infant and child
mortality, and immunization rates. However, income distribution is
very uneven, and the poor, agriculturalists, and indigenous people
continue to have less access to healthcare services. Nicaragua's
total fertility rate has fallen from around 6 children per woman in
1980 to below replacement level today, but the high birth rate
among adolescents perpetuates a cycle of poverty and low
educational attainment.Nicaraguans emigrate primarily to Costa Rica and to a lesser
extent the United States. Nicaraguan men have been migrating
seasonally to Costa Rica to harvest bananas and coffee since the
early 20th century. Political turmoil, civil war, and natural
disasters from the 1970s through the 1990s dramatically increased
the flow of refugees and permanent migrants seeking jobs, higher
wages, and better social and healthcare benefits. Since 2000,
Nicaraguan emigration to Costa Rica has slowed and stabilized.
Today roughly 300,000 Nicaraguans are permanent residents of Costa
Rica - about 75% of the foreign population - and thousands more
migrate seasonally for work, many illegally.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Nicaragua’s telecoms market
has mirrored the country’s poor economic achievements, with
fixed-line teledensity and mobile penetration also being the lowest
in Central America; the fixed line broadband market remains
nascent, with population penetration below 4%; most internet users
are concentrated in the largest cities, given that rural and
marginal areas lack access to the most basic telecom
infrastructure; internet cafés provide public access to internet
and email services, but these also tend to be restricted to the
larger population centers; to address poor infrastructure, the
World Bank has funded a project aimed at improving connectivity via
a national fiber broadband network; there are separate schemes to
improve broadband in eastern regions and provide links to Caribbean
submarine cables; the number of mobile subscribers overtook the
number of fixed lines in early 2002, and the mobile sector now
accounts for most lines in service (2021)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: since privatization, access to
fixed-line and mobile-cellular services has improved; fixed-line
teledensity roughly 3 per 100 persons; mobile-cellular telephone
subscribership has increased to roughly 90 per 100 persons
(2020)<br/>

international: country code - 505; landing point

and the US; satellite earth stations - 1 Intersputnik (Atlantic
Ocean region) and 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) (2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

      <subsection title="Disputes - international">Nicaragua-El Salvador-Honduras: the 1992 ICJ ruling for
El Salvador and Honduras advised a tripartite resolution to
establish a maritime boundary in the Gulf of Fonseca, which
considers Honduran access to the Pacific; the court ruled, rather,
that the Gulf of Fonseca represents a condominium, with
control being shared by El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua; the
decision allowed for the possibility that the three nations could
divide the waters at a later date if they wished to do soNicaragua-Costa Rica: Nicaragua and
Costa Rica regularly file border dispute cases with the ICJ over
the delimitations of the San Juan River and the northern tip of
Calero Island, virtually uninhabited areas claimed by both
countries; there is an ongoing case in the ICJ to determine Pacific
and Atlantic ocean maritime borders as well as land borders; in
2009, the ICJ ruled that Costa Rican vessels carrying out police
activities could not use the river, but official Costa Rican
vessels providing essential services to riverside inhabitants and
Costa Rican tourists could travel freely on the river; in 2011, the
ICJ provisionally ruled that both countries must remove personnel
from the disputed area; in 2013, the ICJ rejected Nicaragua's 2012
suit to halt Costa Rica's construction of a highway paralleling the
river on the grounds of irreparable environmental damage; in 2013,
the ICJ, regarding the disputed territory, ordered that Nicaragua
should refrain from dredging or canal construction and refill and
repair damage caused by trenches connecting the river to the
Caribbean and upheld its 2010 ruling that Nicaragua must remove all
personnel; in early 2014, Costa Rica brought Nicaragua to the ICJ
over offshore oil concessions in the disputed region; in 2018, the
ICJ ruled that Nicaragua must remove a military base from a
contested coastal area near the San Juan River, and that Costa Rica
had sovereignty over the northern part of Isla Portillos, including
the coast, but excluding Harbour Head Lagoon; additionally,
Honduras was required to pay reparations for environmental damage
to part of the wetlands at the mouth of the San Juan RiverNicaragua-Colombia: Nicaragua filed a
case with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Colombia
in 2013 over the delimitation of the Continental shelf beyond the
200 nautical miles from the Nicaraguan coast, as well as over the
alleged violation by Colombia of Nicaraguan maritime space in the
Caribbean Sea, which contains rich oil and fish resources; as of
September 2021, Colombia refuses to abide by the ICJ rulingNicaragua-Honduras: none identified</subsection>
      <subsection title="Trafficking in persons">tier rating: Tier 3 — Nicaragua does not fully
meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and
is not making significant efforts to do so and was downgraded to
Tier 3; the government identified slightly more victims than in the
previous reporting period and prosecuted a trafficker; however, no
traffickers were convicted and victim identification remained
inadequate; authorities did not  investigate, prosecute, or
convict government employees complicit in trafficking; the
government provided no victim services; prosecution, protection,
and prevention efforts in the two Caribbean autonomous regions of
Nicaragua continued to be much weaker than in the rest of the
country (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
trafficking profile: human traffickers exploit
domestic and foreign victims in Nicaragua and Nicaraguans abroad;
women, children, and migrants are most at risk; women and children
are subject to sex trafficking within the country and its two
Caribbean autonomous regions, as well as  in other Central
American countries, Mexico, Spain, and the United States;
traffickers used social media to recruit victims with promises of
high-paying jobs in restaurants, hotels, construction, and security
outside of Nicaragua where they are subjected to sex or labor
trafficking; traffickers exploit children through forced
participation in illegal drug production and trafficking; children
and persons with disabilities are subjected to forced begging;
Nicaragua is also a destination for child sex tourists from the
United States, Canada, and Western Europe</subsection>
