   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">A sultanate since the 12th century, the Maldives became a
British protectorate in 1887. The islands became a republic in
1968, three years after independence. President Maumoon Abdul
GAYOOM dominated Maldives' political scene for 30 years, elected to
six successive terms by single-party referendums. Following
political demonstrations in the capital Male in August 2003, GAYOOM
and his government pledged to embark upon a process of
liberalization and democratic reforms, including a more
representative political system and expanded political freedoms.
Political parties were legalized in 2005.In June 2008, a constituent assembly - termed the "Special
Majlis" - finalized a new constitution ratified by GAYOOM in August
2008. The first-ever presidential elections under a
multi-candidate, multi-party system were held in October 2008.
GAYOOM was defeated in a runoff poll by Mohamed NASHEED, a
political activist who had been jailed several years earlier by the
GAYOOM regime. In early February 2012, after several weeks of
street protests in response to his ordering the arrest of a top
judge, NASHEED purportedly resigned the presidency and handed over
power to Vice President Mohammed WAHEED Hassan Maniku. A
government-appointed Commission of National Inquiry concluded there
was no evidence of a coup, but NASHEED contends that police and
military personnel forced him to resign. NASHEED, WAHEED, and
Abdulla YAMEEN Abdul Gayoom ran in the 2013 elections with YAMEEN
ultimately winning the presidency after three rounds of voting. As
president, YAMEEN weakened democratic institutions, curtailed civil
liberties, jailed his political opponents, restricted the press,
and exerted control over the judiciary to strengthen his hold on
power and limit dissent. In September 2018, YAMEEN lost his
reelection bid to Ibrahim Mohamed SOLIH, a parliamentarian of the
Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), who had the support of a
coalition of four parties that came together to defeat YAMEEN and
restore democratic norms to Maldives. In April 2019, SOLIH's MDP
won 65 of 87 seats in parliament.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: with its economy so heavily
dependent on tourism, the Maldives has suffered heavy economic as
well as health casualties during the pandemic; the country had a
relatively short period of lock down and was willing to welcome
visitors back as early as July 2020; but the effective shutdown of
international air travel for most of the year resulted in the
bottom falling out of the Maldives’ tourism industry, taking GDP
down 32% in the process; the economy fared better in 2021, with a
return to growth, yet it may still be a few years before the
country’s key industries can return to the same level of prosperity
that they previously enjoyed; the country’s high number of tourists
and expatriate workers has inflated the penetration rate for mobile
services, making it one of the highest in the world; that rate
crashed in 2020 as demand for SIM cards (primarily prepaid) dried
up; however, the number of contract subscribers increased as locals
took advantage of competitive pricing offers from operators;
everything now rests on a fast return to normality, with tourists
helping to boost the nation’s coffers as well as buying up those
prepaid SIM cards; with commercial 5G services already launched and
fiber networks rapidly expanding around the country, the Maldives
is primed to deliver world-class telecommunications services to its
domestic and international customers (2021)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line is at nearly 3 per 100
persons and mobile-cellular subscriptions stands at nearly 133 per
100 persons (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 960; landing points
for Dhiraagu Cable Network, NaSCOM, Dhiraagu-SLT Submarine Cable
Networks and WARF submarine cables providing connections to 8
points in Maldives, India, and Sri Lanka; satellite earth
station - 3 Intelsat (Indian Ocean) (2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
