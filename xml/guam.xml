   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Guam was settled by Austronesian people around 1500 B.C. These
people became the indigenous Chamorro and were influenced by later
migrations, including the Micronesians in the first millennium
A.D., and island Southeast Asians around 900. Society was
stratified with higher classes living along the coast and lower
classes living inland. Spanish explorer Ferdinand MAGELLAN was the
first European to see Guam in 1521 and Spain claimed the island in
1565 as it served as a refueling stop for ships between Mexico and
the Philippines. Spain formally colonized Guam in 1668. Spain’s
brutal repression of the Chamorro, along with new diseases and
intermittent warfare, reduced the indigenous population from more
than 100,000 to less than 5,000 by the 1700s. Spain tried to
repopulate the island by forcing people from nearby islands to
settle on Guam and preventing them from escaping.

Guam became a hub for whalers and traders in the western Pacific in
the early 1800s. During the 1898 Spanish-American War, the US Navy
occupied Guam and set up a military administration. The US Navy
opposed local control of government despite repeated petitions by
the Chamorro. Japan invaded Guam in 1941 and instituted a
repressive regime. During the US recapture of Guam in 1944, the
island’s two largest villages were destroyed. After World War II,
political pressure from local Chamorro leaders led to Guam being
established as an unincorporated organized territory in 1950 with
US citizenship granted to all Chamorro. In a referendum in 1982,
more than 75% of voters chose closer relations with the US over
independence, although no change in status was made because of
disagreements on the future right of Chamorro self-determination.
The US military holds about 29% of Guam’s land and stations several
thousand troops on the island. The installations are some of the
most strategically important US bases in the Pacific; they also
constitute the island’s most important source of income and
economic stability.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">Guam’s telecommunications companies provide important services that allow other businesses on island to operate; Guam plays a larger, and growing role, in global telecommunications infrastructure, the submarine fiber optic cables that land on Guam benefit island residents and the local economy; in the Asia-Pacific region the demand for 4G, 5G, and broadband access is rapidly increasing; the 11 submarine cables that currently land on Guam, connecting the U.S. to the Asia-Pacific region, are some of the more than 400 cables that are the backbone of global telecommunications, providing nearly all of the world’s internet and phone service (2021)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>
