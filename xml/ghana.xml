   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Ghana is a multiethnic country rich in natural resources and is
one of the most stable and democratic countries in West Africa.
Ghana has been inhabited for at least several thousand years,
however, little is known about its early inhabitants. By the 12th
century, the gold trade started to boom in Bono (Bonoman) state in
what is today southern Ghana, and it became the genesis of Akan
power and wealth in the region. Beginning in the 15th century, the
Portuguese, followed by other European powers, arrived and
contested for trading rights. Numerous kingdoms and empires emerged
in the area, among the most powerful were the Kingdom of Dagbon in
the north and the Asante (Ashanti) Empire in the south. By the
mid-18th century, Asante was a highly organized state with immense
wealth; it provided enslaved people for the Atlantic slave trade,
and in return received firearms that facilitated its territorial
expansion. The Asante resisted increasing British influence in the
coastal areas, engaging in a series of wars during the 19th century
before ultimately falling under British control. Formed from the
merger of the British colony of the Gold Coast and the Togoland
trust territory, Ghana in 1957 became the first Sub-Saharan country
in colonial Africa to gain its independence, with Kwame NKRUMAH as
its first leader.

Ghana endured a series of coups before Lt. Jerry RAWLINGS took
power in 1981 and banned political parties. After approving a new
constitution and restoring multiparty politics in 1992, RAWLINGS
won presidential elections in 1992 and 1996 but was
constitutionally prevented from running for a third term in 2000.
John KUFUOR of the opposition New Patriotic Party (NPP) succeeded
him and was reelected in 2004. John Atta MILLS of the National
Democratic Congress won the 2008 presidential election and took
over as head of state. MILLS died in July 2012 and was
constitutionally succeeded by his vice president, John Dramani
MAHAMA, who subsequently won the December 2012 presidential
election. In 2016, Nana Addo Dankwa AKUFO-ADDO of the NPP defeated
MAHAMA, marking the third time that Ghana’s presidency had changed
parties since the return to democracy. AKUFO-ADDO was reelected in
2020. In recent years, Ghana has taken an active role in promoting
regional stability and is highly integrated in international
affairs.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Ghana has a young age structure, with approximately 56% of the
population under the age of 25 as of 2020. Its total fertility rate
fell significantly during the 1980s and 1990s but has stalled at
around four children per woman for the last few years. Fertility
remains higher in the northern region than the Greater Accra
region. On average, desired fertility has remained stable for
several years; urban dwellers want fewer children than rural
residents. Increased life expectancy, due to better health care,
nutrition, and hygiene, and reduced fertility have increased
Ghana’s share of elderly persons; Ghana’s proportion of persons
aged 60+ is among the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Poverty has
declined in Ghana, but it remains pervasive in the northern region,
which is susceptible to droughts and floods and has less access to
transportation infrastructure, markets, fertile farming land, and
industrial centers. The northern region also has lower school
enrollment, higher illiteracy, and fewer opportunities for
women.Ghana was a country of immigration in the early years after its
1957 independence, attracting labor migrants largely from Nigeria
and other neighboring countries to mine minerals and harvest cocoa
– immigrants composed about 12% of Ghana’s population in 1960. In
the late 1960s, worsening economic and social conditions
discouraged immigration, and hundreds of thousands of immigrants,
mostly Nigerians, were expelled.During the 1970s, severe drought and an economic downturn
transformed Ghana into a country of emigration; neighboring Cote
d’Ivoire was the initial destination. Later, hundreds of thousands
of Ghanaians migrated to Nigeria to work in its booming oil
industry, but most were deported in 1983 and 1985 as oil prices
plummeted. Many Ghanaians then turned to more distant destinations,
including other parts of Africa, Europe, and North America, but the
majority continued to migrate within West Africa. Since the 1990s,
increased emigration of skilled Ghanaians, especially to the US and
the UK, drained the country of its health care and education
professionals. Internally, poverty and other developmental
disparities continue to drive Ghanaians from the north to the
south, particularly to its urban centers.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Military - note">the primary missions for the Ghanaian military include assisting
other security services with internal security and patrolling the
country’s economic exclusion zone, which has led to efforts to
expand the Navy’s capabilities in recent years; in 2022, Ghana
beefed up its military presence in the north of the country against
threats from the terrorist organization Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal
Muslimin (JNIM), a coalition of al-Qa'ida linked militant groups,
which has conducted attacks in the neighboring countries of Burkina
Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, and Togo

the military of Ghana traces its origins to the Gold Coast
Constabulary that was established in 1879 and renamed the Gold
Coast Regiment in 1901; the Gold Coast Regiment was part of the
West African Frontier Force (WAFF), a multi-regiment force formed
by the British colonial office in 1900 to garrison the West African
colonies of Gold Coast (Ghana), Nigeria (Lagos and the
protectorates of Northern and Southern Nigeria), Sierra Leone, and
Gambia; the WAFF served with distinction in both East and West
Africa during World War I; in 1928, it received royal recognition
and was re-named the Royal West African Frontier Force (RWAFF); the
RWAFF went on to serve in World War II as part of the British 81st
and 82nd (West African) divisions in the East Africa and Burma
campaigns; following independence in 1957, the Gold Coast Regiment
formed the basis for the new Ghanaian Army (2022)</subsection>
      <subsection title="Maritime threats">the International Maritime Bureau reports the territorial and
offshore waters in the Niger Delta and Gulf of Guinea remain a very
high risk for piracy and armed robbery of ships; in 2021, there
were 34 reported incidents of piracy and armed robbery at sea in
the Gulf of Guinea region; although a significant decrease from the
total number of 81 incidents in 2020, it included the one hijacking
and three of five ships fired upon worldwide; while boarding and
attempted boarding to steal valuables from ships and crews are the
most common types of incidents, almost a third of all incidents
involve a hijacking and/or kidnapping; in 2021, 57 crew members
were kidnapped in seven separate incidents in the Gulf of Guinea,
representing 100% of kidnappings worldwide; Nigerian pirates in
particular are well armed and very aggressive, operating as far as
200 nm offshore; the Maritime Administration of the US Department
of Transportation has issued a Maritime Advisory (2022-001 - Gulf
of Guinea-Piracy/Armed Robbery/Kidnapping for Ransom) effective 4
January 2022, which states in part, "Piracy, armed robbery, and
kidnapping for ransom continue to serve as significant threats to
US-flagged vessels transiting or operating in the Gulf of
Guinea"</subsection>
