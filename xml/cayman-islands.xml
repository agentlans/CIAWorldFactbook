   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Cayman Islands were colonized from Jamaica by the British
during the 18th and 19th centuries and were administered by Jamaica
after 1863. In 1959, the islands became a territory within the
Federation of the West Indies. When the Federation dissolved in
1962, the Cayman Islands chose to remain a British dependency. The
territory has transformed itself into a significant offshore
financial center.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">the telecom sector has seen a decline in subscriber numbers (particularly for prepaid mobile services the mainstay of short term visitors) and revenue; fixed and mobile broadband services are two areas that have benefited from the crisis as employees and students have resorted to working from home; one area of the telecom market that is not prepared for growth is 5G mobile; governments, regulators, and even the mobile network operators have shown that they have not been investing in 5G opportunities at the present time; network expansion and enhancements remain concentrated around improving LTE coverage (2021)</note>
         <note title="domestic">introduction of competition in the mobile-cellular market in 2004 boosted subscriptions; nearly 55 per 100 fixed-line and 152 per 100 mobile-cellular (2020)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>
