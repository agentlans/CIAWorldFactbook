   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Kiribati is made up of three distinct island groups - the
Gilbert Islands, the Line Islands, and the Phoenix Islands. The
first Austronesian voyagers arrived in the Gilbert Islands as early
as 3000 B.C., but these islands were not widely settled until about
A.D. 200 by Micronesians. Around 1300, Samoans and Tongans invaded
the southern Gilbert Islands, bringing Polynesian cultural elements
with them. Later arrivals by Fijians brought Melanesian elements to
the Gilbert Islands, and extensive intermarriage between the
Micronesian, Polynesian, and Melanesian people led to the creation
of what would become Gilbertese cultural traditions by the time
Europeans spotted the islands in the 1600s. The Phoenix Islands and
Line Islands were both visited by various Melanesian and Polynesian
peoples, but their isolation and lack of natural resources meant
that long-term settlements were not possible and both island groups
were uninhabited by the time of European contact.<br/>
 <br/>
Kiribati experienced sustained European contact by the 1760s; all
three island groups were named and charted by 1826. American
whaling ships frequently passed through the islands, and the UK
declared a protectorate over the Gilbert and nearby Ellice Islands
in 1892 to block growing US influence. Phosphate-rich Banaba Island
was annexed to the protectorate in 1900. In 1916, the protectorate
became a colony, and some Line Islands were added in 1916 and 1919,
with the final ones added in 1972. The Phoenix Islands were added
to the colony in 1937, and the UK agreed to share jurisdiction of
some of them with the US because of their strategic location for
aviation. Japan occupied the northern Gilbert Islands in 1941; the
islands of Makin and Tarawa were the sites of major US amphibious
victories over entrenched Japanese garrisons in 1943. The UK
continued to rule the colony after World War II. The Ellice Islands
became its own colony in 1974. The Gilbert Islands became fully
self-governing in 1977 and independent in 1979 as Kiribati, the
Gilbertese spelling of Gilberts. The US relinquished all claims to
the sparsely inhabited Phoenix and Line Islands in a 1979 treaty of
friendship.<br/>
         <br/>
In 1994, Kiribati adjusted the international date line to the east
of the Line Islands, bringing all islands in the country to the
same day and giving Kiribati the earliest time zone in the world.
Kiribati is a leading climate change and marine protection
advocate. The Phoenix Islands Protected Area was established in
2008; in 2010, it became the world's largest (and deepest) UNESCO
World Heritage site. In 2012, Kiribati purchased a 22 sq km (8.5 sq
mi) plot of land in Fiji for potential eventual resettlement of its
population because of climate change.</subsection>

downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward

infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
