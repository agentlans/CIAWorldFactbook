   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Azerbaijan - a secular nation with a majority-Turkic and
majority-Shia Muslim population - was briefly independent (from
1918 to 1920) following the collapse of the Russian Empire; it was
subsequently incorporated into the Soviet Union for seven decades.
Azerbaijan remains involved in the protracted Nagorno-Karabakh
conflict with Armenia. Nagorno-Karabakh was a primarily ethnic
Armenian region that Moscow recognized in 1923 as an autonomous
oblast within Soviet Azerbaijan. In the late Soviet period, a
separatist movement developed which sought to end Azerbaijani
control over the region. Fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh began in
1988 and escalated after Armenia and Azerbaijan attained
independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. By the time a ceasefire
took effect in May 1994, separatists, with Armenian support,
controlled Nagorno‑Karabakh and seven surrounding Azerbaijani
territories.Under the terms of a cease-fire agreement following Azerbaijan’s
victory in the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War that took place from
September-November 2020, Armenia returned to Azerbaijan the
remaining territories it had occupied and also the southern part of
Nagorno-Karabakh, including the culturally and historically
important city that Azerbaijanis call Shusha and Armenians call
Shushi. Despite Azerbaijan’s territorial gains, peace in the region
remains elusive because of unsettled issues concerning the
delimitation of borders, the opening of regional transportation and
communication links, the status of ethnic enclaves near border
regions, and the final status of the Nagorno-Karabakh region.
Russian peacekeepers deployed to Nagorno-Karabakh to supervise the
cease-fire for a minimum five-year term did not prevent the
outbreak of sporadic, low-level military clashes along the
Azerbaijan-Armenia border in 2021.

In the three decades following its independence in 1991, Azerbaijan
has succeeded in significantly reducing the poverty rate and has
directed revenues from its oil and gas production to develop the
country’s infrastructure. However, corruption remains a burden on
the economy, and Western observers and members of the country’s
political opposition have accused the government of
authoritarianism, pointing to elections that are neither free nor
fair, state control of the media, and the systematic abuse of human
rights targeting individuals and groups who are perceived as
threats to the administration. The country’s leadership has
remained in the ALIYEV family since Heydar ALIYEV, formerly the
most highly ranked Azerbaijani member of the Communist Party during
the Soviet period, became president in the midst of the first
Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1993. Heydar ALIYEV groomed his son to
succeed him, and Ilham ALIYEV subsequently became president in
2003. As a result of two national referendums that eliminated
presidential term limits and extended the presidential term from 5
to 7 years, President ALIYEV secured a fourth term in April 2018 in
an election that international observers noted had serious
shortcomings. Reforms are underway to diversify the country’s
economy away from its dependence on oil and gas; additional reforms
are needed to address weaknesses in government institutions,
particularly in the education and health sectors, and the court
system.</subsection>

eastern part of the country has the highest population density,
particularly in and around Baku. Apart from smaller urbanized
areas, the rest of the country has a fairly light and evenly
distributed population. Approximately 57% of the country’s
inhabitants lives in urban areas.  While the population is
continuing to grow, it is in the early stages of aging. The
declining fertility rate – which has decreased from about 5.5
children per woman in the 1950s to less than the 2.1 replacement
level in 2022 – combined with increasing life expectancy has
resulted in the elderly making up a larger share of Azerbaijan’s
populace. The percentage of elderly residents and the slowed growth
and eventual shrinkage of the working-age population could put
pressure on the country’s pension and healthcare systems. </subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">in spite of the telecom sector being one of the major contributors to Azerbaijan’s non-oil GDP, overall development, growth, and investment in the sector has been held back by years of political and civil unrest coupled with endemic corruption; mobile penetration rates reached 100% as far back as 2011 but have largely stagnated since then; the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) are slowly extending the reach of their LTE networks around the country, and this increased coverage (along with access to faster data-based services) is expected to produce a moderate resurgence for both mobile and mobile broadband over the next few years as customers migrate from 3G to 4G. 5G services are still some ways off, as the demand for high-speed data and fast broadband can easily be met by existing capacity on LTE networks; fixed-line teledensity continues to drop down each year as customers consolidate their telecommunications services around the mobile platform; the rate of decline is comparatively slower than other countries, since Azerbaijan has a relatively high proportion of (87%) of fixed-line broadband customers still on DSL; fiber is gradually being rolled out in urban areas, and this makes up the bulk of the growth being seen in the overall fixed broadband market; DSL’s predominance, however, will serve to keep Azerbaijan’s average access speeds in the sub-10Mbps range for the foreseeable future (2020)</note>

      <subsection title="Military - note">since November 2020, Russia has deployed about 2,000
peacekeeping troops to the area in and around Nagorno-Karabakh as
part of a cease-fire agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan;
fighting erupted between the two countries over the
Nagorno-Karabakh region in September of 2020; Nagorno-Karabakh lies
within Azerbaijan but has been under control of ethnic Armenian
forces (the "Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army") backed by Armenia
since a separatist war there ended in 1994; six weeks of fighting
resulted in about 6,500 deaths and ended after Armenia ceded swaths
of Nagorno-Karabakh territory; tensions remained high in 2022, and
both sides have accused the other of provocations since the
fighting ended; Armenia has accused Azerbaijani forces of a series
of border intrusions and of seizing pockets of territory (2023)</subsection>

      <subsection title="Disputes - international">Local border forces struggle to control the illegal transit of
goods and people across the porous, undemarcated Armenian,
Azerbaijani, and Georgian borders.

Armenia-Azerbaijan: The dispute over the break-away
Nagorno-Karabakh region and the Armenian military occupation of
surrounding lands in Azerbaijan remains the primary focus of
regional instability. Residents have evacuated the former
Soviet-era small ethnic enclaves in Armenia and Azerbaijan.

Azerbaijan-Georgia: A joint boundary commission agrees on
most of the alignment, leaving only small areas at
certain crossing points in dispute.  Consequently,
the two states have yet to agree on a delimitation or
demarcation of their common boundary. One area of
contention is where the international boundary should run
through the 6th-13th Century David-Gareja monastery
complex.

Azerbaijan-Iran: none identified

Azerbaijan-Russia: Russia complains of cross-border
smuggling.

Azerbaijan-Turkey: none identified

Caspian Sea (Maritime Boundary): Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan,
and Russia ratified the Caspian seabed delimitation treaties based
on equidistance, while Iran continues to insist on a one-fifth
slice of the sea. Bilateral talks continue with Turkmenistan on
dividing the seabed and contested oilfields in the middle of the
Caspian.</subsection>
