   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Dutch United Provinces declared their independence from
Spain in 1579; during the 17th century, they became a leading
seafaring and commercial power, with settlements and colonies
around the world. After a 20-year French occupation, a Kingdom of
the Netherlands was formed in 1815. In 1830, Belgium seceded and
formed a separate kingdom. The Netherlands remained neutral in
World War I but suffered German invasion and occupation in World
War II. A modern, industrialized nation, the Netherlands is also a
large exporter of agricultural products. The country was a founding
member of NATO and the EEC (now the EU) and participated in the
introduction of the euro in 1999. In October 2010, the former
Netherlands Antilles was dissolved and the three smallest islands -
Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba - became special municipalities
in the Netherlands administrative structure. The larger islands of
Sint Maarten and Curacao joined the Netherlands and Aruba as
constituent countries forming the Kingdom of the Netherlands.In February 2018, the Sint Eustatius island council (governing
body) was dissolved and replaced by a government commissioner to
restore the integrity of public administration. According to the
Dutch Government, the intervention will be as "short as possible
and as long as needed."</subsection>

      <subsection title="Flag description">three equal horizontal bands of red (bright vermilion; top),
white, and blue (cobalt); similar to the flag of Luxembourg, which
uses a lighter blue and is longer; the colors were derived from
those of WILLIAM I, Prince of Orange, who led the Dutch Revolt
against Spanish sovereignty in the latter half of the 16th century;
originally the upper band was orange, but because its dye tended to
turn red over time, the red shade was eventually made the permanent
color; the banner is perhaps the oldest tricolor in continuous
use</subsection>

note: adopted 1932, in use since the 17th century,
making it the oldest national anthem in the world; also known as
"Wilhelmus van Nassouwe" (William of Nassau), it is in the form of

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: telecom infrastructure in
the Netherlands continues to be upgraded as modernization schemes
undertaken by telcos make steady progress; other fiber providers
have been supported by regulatory measures which have encouraged
municipal governments to intervene with telcosâ€™ fiber builds,
facilitating open access networks in a bid to make rollouts
cheaper, and completed sooner; while the Mobile Network Operators
(MNOs) are also closing down their Global System for Mobile
Communication (MSM) and 3G networks and repurposing their spectrum
and physical assets for LTE and 5G, the regulator has also
encouraged GSM/3G roaming in the interim, thus safeguarding
services such as machine to machine and other low data-use
applications while individual MNOs disable their own GSM/3G
networks; the country has one of the highest fixed broadband
penetration rates in the world, with effective cross-platform
competition between Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), Hybrid Fiber
Coazial (HFC), and fiber networks; in the third quarter of 2020 the
number of cable broadband connections fell for the first time,
while the DSL segment has long been eclipsed by fiber; by the end
of 2021, over a quarter of fixed broadband connections were on
fiber infrastructure, while DSL accounted for only about 29%;
almost 49% of fixed connections provided data above 100Mb/s, while
an additional 43.7% provided data of at least 30Mb/s (2022)<br/>

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
