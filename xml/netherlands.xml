   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Dutch United Provinces declared their independence from
Spain in 1579; during the 17th century, they became a leading
seafaring and commercial power, with settlements and colonies
around the world. After a 20-year French occupation, a Kingdom of
the Netherlands was formed in 1815. In 1830, Belgium seceded and
formed a separate kingdom. The Netherlands remained neutral in
World War I but suffered German invasion and occupation in World
War II. A modern, industrialized nation, the Netherlands is also a
large exporter of agricultural products. The country was a founding
member of NATO and the EEC (now the EU) and participated in the
introduction of the euro in 1999. In October 2010, the former
Netherlands Antilles was dissolved and the three smallest islands -
Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba - became special municipalities
in the Netherlands administrative structure. The larger islands of
Sint Maarten and Curacao joined the Netherlands and Aruba as
constituent countries forming the Kingdom of the Netherlands.In February 2018, the Sint Eustatius island council (governing
body) was dissolved and replaced by a government commissioner to
restore the integrity of public administration. According to the
Dutch Government, the intervention will be as "short as possible
and as long as needed."</subsection>

      <subsection title="Flag description">three equal horizontal bands of red (bright vermilion; top),
white, and blue (cobalt); similar to the flag of Luxembourg, which
uses a lighter blue and is longer; the colors were derived from
those of WILLIAM I, Prince of Orange, who led the Dutch Revolt
against Spanish sovereignty in the latter half of the 16th century;
originally the upper band was orange, but because its dye tended to
turn red over time, the red shade was eventually made the permanent
color; the banner is perhaps the oldest tricolor in continuous
use</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">telecom infrastructure in the Netherlands continues to be upgraded as modernization schemes undertaken by telcos make steady progress; other fiber providers have been supported by regulatory measures which have encouraged municipal governments to intervene with telcos’ fiber builds, facilitating open access networks in a bid to make rollouts cheaper, and completed sooner; while the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) are also closing down their Global System for Mobile Communication (MSM) and 3G networks and repurposing their spectrum and physical assets for LTE and 5G, the regulator has also encouraged GSM/3G roaming in the interim, thus safeguarding services such as machine to machine and other low data-use applications while individual MNOs disable their own GSM/3G networks; the country has one of the highest fixed broadband penetration rates in the world, with effective cross-platform competition between Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), Hybrid Fiber Coazial (HFC), and fiber networks; in the third quarter of 2020 the number of cable broadband connections fell for the first time, while the DSL segment has long been eclipsed by fiber; by the end of 2021, over a quarter of fixed broadband connections were on fiber infrastructure, while DSL accounted for only about 29%; almost 49% of fixed connections provided data above 100Mb/s, while an additional 43.7% provided data of at least 30Mb/s (2022)</note>
