   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Montevideo, founded by the Spanish in 1726 as a military
stronghold, soon became an important commercial center due to its
natural harbor. Claimed by Argentina but annexed by Brazil in 1821,
Uruguay declared its independence in 1825 and secured its freedom
in 1828 after a three-year struggle. The administrations of
President Jose BATLLE in the early 20th century launched widespread
political, social, and economic reforms that established a statist
tradition. A violent Marxist urban guerrilla movement named the
Tupamaros (or Movimiento de Liberación Nacional-Tupamaros (MLN-T)),
launched in the late 1960s, led Uruguay's president to cede control
of the government to the military in 1973. By yearend, the rebels
had been crushed, but the military continued to expand its hold
over the government. Civilian rule was restored in 1985. In 2004,
the left-of-center Frente Amplio Coalition won national elections
that effectively ended 170 years of political control previously
held by the Colorado and National (Blanco) parties. The
left-of-center retained the presidency and control of both chambers
of congress until 2019. Uruguay's political and labor conditions
are among the freest on the continent.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Uruguay rates high for most development indicators and is known
for its secularism, liberal social laws, and well-developed social
security, health, and educational systems. It is one of the few
countries in Latin America and the Caribbean where the entire
population has access to clean water. Uruguay's provision of free
primary through university education has contributed to the
country's high levels of literacy and educational attainment.
However, the emigration of human capital has diminished the state's
return on its investment in education. Remittances from the roughly
18% of Uruguayans abroad amount to less than 1 percent of national
GDP. The emigration of young adults and a low birth rate are
causing Uruguay's population to age rapidly.In the 1960s, Uruguayans for the first time emigrated en masse -
primarily to Argentina and Brazil - because of economic decline and
the onset of more than a decade of military dictatorship. Economic
crises in the early 1980s and 2002 also triggered waves of
emigration, but since 2002 more than 70% of Uruguayan emigrants
have selected the US and Spain as destinations because of better
job prospects. Uruguay had a tiny population upon its independence
in 1828 and welcomed thousands of predominantly Italian and Spanish
immigrants, but the country has not experienced large influxes of
new arrivals since the aftermath of World War II. More recent
immigrants include Peruvians and Arabs.</subsection>

corner with a yellow sun bearing a human face (delineated in black)

triangular and wavy; the stripes represent the nine original
departments of Uruguay; the sun symbol evokes the legend of the sun
breaking through the clouds on 25 May 1810 as independence was
first declared from Spain (Uruguay subsequently won its
independence from Brazil); the sun features are said to represent
those of Inti, the Inca god of the sun

         <note title="general assessment">Uruguay has an advanced telecom market, with excellent infrastructure and one of the highest broadband penetration rates in Latin America; fixed-line teledensity is also particularly high for the region, while mobile penetration is the second highest after Panama; in terms of computer penetration, Uruguay tops all other countries in the region by a considerable margin, and this has facilitated growth in fixed-line broadband adoption; the government and telecom regulator have introduced a range of measures to help develop the deployment of fiber infrastructure, partly in a bid to encourage economic growth and stimulate e-commerce; fiber accounted for about 77% of all fixed and fixed-wireless broadband connections as of June 2020; with investment projected to reach $800 million, the state-owned incumbent Antel is expected to provide national FttP coverage by early 2022; together with the FttP network, the opening of the submarine cable system in early 2012 and August 2017 have helped boost Uruguay’s internet bandwidth, and increase the data rate available to end-users; Uruguay is one of the very few Latin American countries where the local fixed-line market is neither privatized nor liberalized; other segments of the telecom market have been opened to competition, including international long-distance telephony, mobile telephony, and fixed-wireless broadband; Uruguay is also one of the few countries in the world where broadband access via cable modem does not exist; although cable networks are well equipped technologically, and digital cable TV is widely available, telecom legislation prohibits data transmission over pay TV networks; the government announced in December 2020 that it intended to introduce changes to the law to permit pay TV providers to offer internet and telephony packages over their own networks; all three operators offer mobile broadband through 3G and LTE networks; operators have achieved nationwide 3G coverage and the number of mobile broadband subscribers continues to grow; at the end of 2019, spectrum in the 5G-suitable range was auctioned, enabling operators to launch 5G services; the regulator is working on a spectrum and connectivity policy that emphasizes 5G (2021)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>
