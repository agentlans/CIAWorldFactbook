   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Montevideo, founded by the Spanish in 1726 as a military
stronghold, soon became an important commercial center due to its
natural harbor. Claimed by Argentina but annexed by Brazil in 1821,
Uruguay declared its independence in 1825 and secured its freedom
in 1828 after a three-year struggle. The administrations of
President Jose BATLLE in the early 20th century launched widespread
political, social, and economic reforms that established a statist
tradition. A violent Marxist urban guerrilla movement named the
Tupamaros (or Movimiento de Liberación Nacional-Tupamaros (MLN-T)),
launched in the late 1960s, led Uruguay's president to cede control
of the government to the military in 1973. By yearend, the rebels
had been crushed, but the military continued to expand its hold
over the government. Civilian rule was restored in 1985. In 2004,
the left-of-center Frente Amplio Coalition won national elections
that effectively ended 170 years of political control previously
held by the Colorado and National (Blanco) parties. The
left-of-center retained the presidency and control of both chambers
of congress until 2019. Uruguay's political and labor conditions
are among the freest on the continent.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Uruguay rates high for most development indicators and is known
for its secularism, liberal social laws, and well-developed social
security, health, and educational systems. It is one of the few
countries in Latin America and the Caribbean where the entire
population has access to clean water. Uruguay's provision of free
primary through university education has contributed to the
country's high levels of literacy and educational attainment.
However, the emigration of human capital has diminished the state's
return on its investment in education. Remittances from the roughly
18% of Uruguayans abroad amount to less than 1 percent of national
GDP. The emigration of young adults and a low birth rate are
causing Uruguay's population to age rapidly.In the 1960s, Uruguayans for the first time emigrated en masse -
primarily to Argentina and Brazil - because of economic decline and
the onset of more than a decade of military dictatorship. Economic
crises in the early 1980s and 2002 also triggered waves of
emigration, but since 2002 more than 70% of Uruguayan emigrants
have selected the US and Spain as destinations because of better
job prospects. Uruguay had a tiny population upon its independence
in 1828 and welcomed thousands of predominantly Italian and Spanish
immigrants, but the country has not experienced large influxes of
new arrivals since the aftermath of World War II. More recent
immigrants include Peruvians and Arabs.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Uruguay has an advanced
telecom market, with excellent infrastructure and one of the
highest broadband penetration rates in Latin America; fixed-line
teledensity is also particularly high for the region, while mobile
penetration is the second highest after Panama; in terms of
computer penetration, Uruguay tops all other countries in the
region by a considerable margin, and this has facilitated growth in
fixed-line broadband adoption; the government and telecom regulator
have introduced a range of measures to help develop the deployment
of fiber infrastructure, partly in a bid to encourage economic
growth and stimulate e-commerce; fiber accounted for about 77% of
all fixed and fixed-wireless broadband connections as of June 2020;
with investment projected to reach $800 million, the state-owned
incumbent Antel is expected to provide national FttP coverage by
early 2022; together with the FttP network, the opening of the
submarine cable system in early 2012 and August 2017 have helped
boost Uruguay’s internet bandwidth, and increase the data rate
available to end-users; Uruguay is one of the very few Latin
American countries where the local fixed-line market is neither
privatized nor liberalized; other segments of the telecom market
have been opened to competition, including international
long-distance telephony, mobile telephony, and fixed-wireless
broadband; Uruguay is also one of the few countries in the world
where broadband access via cable modem does not exist; although
cable networks are well equipped technologically, and digital cable
TV is widely available, telecom legislation prohibits data
transmission over pay TV networks; the government announced in
December 2020 that it intended to introduce changes to the law to
permit pay TV providers to offer internet and telephony packages
over their own networks; all three operators offer mobile broadband
through 3G and LTE networks; operators have achieved nationwide 3G
coverage and the number of mobile broadband subscribers continues
to grow; at the end of 2019, spectrum in the 5G-suitable range was
auctioned, enabling operators to launch 5G services; the regulator
is working on a spectrum and connectivity policy that emphasizes 5G
(2021)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: most modern facilities concentrated in
Montevideo; nationwide microwave radio relay network; overall
fixed-line roughly 35 per 100 and mobile-cellular teledensity 131
per 100 persons (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 598; landing points
for the Unisor, Tannat, and Bicentenario submarine cable
system providing direct connectivity to Brazil and Argentina;
Bicentenario 2012 and Tannat 2017 cables helped end-users with
Internet bandwidth; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (Atlantic
Ocean) (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
