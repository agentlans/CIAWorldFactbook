   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Voyagers from Samoa first settled on Niue around A.D. 900 and a
second main group of settlers came from Tonga around 1500. With
only one reliable source of fresh water, conflict was high on the
island. There was continued contact with both Samoa and Tonga, and
customs from those islands heavily influenced Niuean culture,
including the formation of an island-wide kingship system in the
early 1700s. These kings, or patu-iki, were elected by Niueans. In
1774, British explorer James COOK abandoned attempts to land on the
island after several unsuccessful tries, and he named it Savage
Island because of the warlike appearance of the Niueans.
Missionaries arrived in 1830 but were also largely unsuccessful at
staying on the island until 1846, when a Niuean trained as a Samoan
missionary returned to the island and provided a space from which
the missionaries could work. In addition to converting the
population, the missionaries worked to stop the violent conflicts
between Niueans and helped establish the first parliament in
1849.In 1889, King FATAAIKI and other chiefs asked the UK for
protectorate status, a request that was repeated in 1895. The UK
finally agreed in 1900 and King TOGIA-PULU-TOAKI formally ceded
Niue that year. In 1901, Niue was annexed to New Zealand and
included as part of the Cook Islands. Niueâ€™s remoteness and
cultural and linguistic differences with the Cook Islands led New
Zealand to separate Niue into its own administration in 1904. The
island became internally self-governing in 1974; it is an
independent member of international organizations but is in free
association with New Zealand, which is responsible for defense and
foreign affairs.Economic opportunities in Niue are sparse. The population has
trended downwards over recent decades, with substantial emigration
to New Zealand. In 2004, a cyclone destroyed much of the southern
part of the capital, Alofi, and left about 15% of the population
homeless. Many chose not to rebuild and instead moved to New
Zealand (2,400 km to the southwest), where approximately 90% of all
ethnic Niueans live.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">in 2020, the Manatua One Polynesia Fiber Cable provided Niue with high speed Internet access for the first time replacing a 4 megabit satellite link with gigabit fiber connectivity; the government set out a strategy to upgrade to a new infrastructure that would be robust enough to operate reliably in a challenging climate: 40 40Â°C heat, 40% humidity, salty air, frequent power outages during storms, and no air conditioning (2022)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>
