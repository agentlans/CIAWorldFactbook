   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The archipelago was once largely under the control of Buddhist
and Hindu rulers. By around the 7th century, a Buddhist kingdom
arose on Sumatra and expanded into Java and the Malay Peninsula
until it was conquered in the late 13th century by the Hindu
Majapahit Empire from Java. Majapahit (1290-1527) united most of
modern-day Indonesia and Malaysia. Traders introduced Islam in the
trade ports around the 11th century, and Indonesians gradually
adopted Islam over the next 500 years. The Portuguese conquered
parts of Indonesia in the 16th century, but they were ousted by the
Dutch (except in East Timor), who began colonizing the islands in
the early 17th century. It would be the early 20th century before
Dutch colonial rule was established across the entirety of what
would become the boundaries of the modern Indonesian state.<br/>
         <br/>
Japan occupied the islands from 1942 to 1945. Indonesia declared
its independence shortly before Japan's surrender, but it required
four years of sometimes brutal fighting, intermittent negotiations,
and UN mediation before the Netherlands agreed to transfer
sovereignty in 1949. A period of sometimes unruly parliamentary
democracy ended in 1957 when President SOEKARNO declared martial
law and instituted "Guided Democracy." After an abortive coup in
1965 by alleged communist sympathizers, SOEKARNO was gradually
eased from power. From 1967 until 1998, President SUHARTO ruled
Indonesia with his "New Order" government. After street protests
toppled SUHARTO in 1998, free and fair legislative elections took
place in 1999. Indonesia is now the world's third most populous
democracy, the world's largest archipelagic state, and the world's
largest Muslim-majority nation.<br/>
         <br/>
Indonesia faces a number of issues, including alleviating poverty,
improving education, preventing terrorism, consolidating democracy
after four decades of authoritarianism, implementing economic and
financial reforms, stemming corruption, reforming the criminal
justice system, addressing climate change, and controlling
infectious diseases, particularly those of global and regional
importance. In 2005, Indonesia reached a historic peace agreement
with armed separatists in Aceh. Indonesia continues to face low
intensity armed resistance in Papua by the separatist Free Papua
Movement.</subsection>

Sunda Islands, Halmahera Island, Sulawesi Island, Sangihe Island,
and in the Banda Sea; Merapi (2,968 m), Indonesia's most active
volcano and in eruption since 2010, has been deemed a Decade
Volcano by the International Association of Volcanology and
Chemistry of the Earth's Interior, worthy of study due to its
explosive history and close proximity to human populations; on 22
December 2018, a large explosion and flank collapse destroyed most
of the 338 m high island of Anak Krakatau (Child of Krakatau) and
generated a deadly tsunami inundating portions of western Java and
southern Sumatra leaving more than 400 dead; other notable
historically active volcanoes include Agung, Awu, Karangetang,
Krakatau (Krakatoa), Makian, Raung, Sinabung, and Tambora; see note

Coordinating Agency for Survey and Mapping, the total number of
islands in the archipelago is 13,466, of which 922 are permanently

the Ring of Fire, a belt of active volcanoes and earthquake
epicenters bordering the Pacific Ocean; up to 90% of the world's

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Indonesia has the world’s fourth-largest population.  It is
predominantly Muslim and has the largest Muslim population of any
country in the world.  The population is projected to increase
to as much as 320 million by 2045.  A government-supported
family planning program.  The total fertility rate (TFR) – the
average number of births per woman – from 5.6 in the mid-1960s to
2.7 in the mid-1990s.  The success of the program was also due
to the social acceptance of family planning, which received backing
from influential Muslim leaders and organizations.The fertility decline slowed in the late 1990’s when
responsibility for family planning programs shifted to the district
level, where the programs were not prioritized.  Since 2012
the national government revitalized the national family planning
program, and Indonesia’s TFR has slowly decreased to 2.3 in 2020.
 The government may reach its goal of achieving replacement
level fertility – 2.1 children per woman – but the large number of
women of childbearing age ensures significant population growth for
many years. Indonesia is a source country for labor migrants, a transit
country for asylum seekers, and a destination mainly for highly
skilled migrant workers.  International labor migration, both
legal and illegal, from Indonesia to other parts of Asia (most
commonly Malaysia) and the Middle East has taken place for decades
because of high unemployment and underemployment, poverty, and low
wages domestically.  Increasing numbers of migrant workers are
drawn to Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the US.  The
majority of Indonesian labor migration is temporary and consists
predominantly of low-skilled workers, mainly women working as
domestics.Indonesia’s strategic location between Asia and Australia and
between the Pacific and Indian Oceans – and its relatively easy
accessibility via boat – appeal to asylum seekers.  It is also
an attractive transit location because of its easy entry
requirements and the ability to continue on to Australia.
 Recent asylum seekers have come from Afghanistan, Burma
(Rohingyas), Iraq, Somalia, and Sri Lanka.  Since 2013, when
Australia tightening its immigration policy, thousands of migrants
and asylum seekers have been stranded in Indonesia, where they live
in precarious conditions and receive only limited support from
international organizations.  The situation for refugees in
Indonesia has also worsened because Australia and the US, which had
resettled the majority of refugees in Indonesia, have significantly
lowered their intake.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Indonesia faces more than
the usual number of obstacles in terms of enabling widespread
access to quality telecommunications services for its population of
more than 270 million; the geographical challenges have been
further compounded by a variety of social, political, and economic
problems over the years that have kept the country’s wealth
distributed very thinly; the fixed-line (fiber) and mobile
operators have continued to expand and upgrade their networks
across the country; Indonesia’s 18,000 islands (many of which,
however, are sparsely populated) makes the deployment of fixed-line
infrastructure on a broad scale difficult; there has been renewed
activity in fiber optic cable, but the bundling of fixed-line
telephony with TV and internet services will see the country’s
teledensity stabilize; mobile subscriptions have reached more than
130% and is projected to exceed 150% by 2026; with 4G LTE
universally available, the major mobile companies have been busy
launching 5G services in selected areas; the rollout of 5G will be
hampered by the lack of availability of suitable frequencies; the
4G had to be reallocated from broadcasting services, and
indications are that the same process is going to have to be
followed in order to allow the expansion of 5G into its core
frequency bands (3.3 to 4.2GHz) (2022)<br/>

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
