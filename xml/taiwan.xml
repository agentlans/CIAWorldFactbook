   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">First inhabited by Austronesian people, Taiwan became home to
Han immigrants beginning in the late Ming Dynasty (17th century).
In 1895, military defeat forced China's Qing Dynasty to cede Taiwan
to Japan, which then governed Taiwan for 50 years. Taiwan came
under Chinese Nationalist (Kuomintang, KMT) control after World War
II. With the communist victory in the Chinese civil war in 1949,
the Nationalist-controlled Republic of China government and 2
million Nationalists fled to Taiwan and continued to claim to be
the legitimate government for mainland China and Taiwan based on a
1947 constitution drawn up for all of China. Until 1987, however,
the Nationalist Government ruled Taiwan under a civil war martial
law declaration dating to 1948. Beginning in the 1970s, Nationalist
authorities gradually began to incorporate the native population
into the governing structure beyond the local level. The
democratization process expanded rapidly in the 1980s, leading to
the then illegal founding of the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), Taiwan’s first opposition party, in 1986 and the lifting of
martial law the following year. Taiwan held legislative elections
in 1992, the first in over forty years, and its first direct
presidential election in 1996. In the 2000 presidential elections,
Taiwan underwent its first peaceful transfer of power with the KMT
loss to the DPP and afterwards experienced two additional
democratic transfers of power in 2008 and 2016. Throughout this
period, the island prospered, became one of East Asia's economic
"Tigers," and after 2000 became a major investor in mainland China
as cross-Strait ties matured. The dominant political issues
continue to be economic reform and growth as well as management of
sensitive relations between Taiwan and China.</subsection>

note 2: although not definitive, the majority of

theory that Taiwan is the ultimate source for the spread of humans
across the Pacific to Polynesia; the expansion (ca. 3000 B.C. to
A.D. 1200) took place via the Philippines and eastern Indonesia and
reached Fiji and Tonga by about 900 B.C.; from there voyagers
spread across the rest of the Pacific islands over the next two

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Taiwan has a highly
developed telecoms sector in both the fixed-line and mobile
segments; in part this is due to the country’s early moves to
liberalize the market, allowing vigorous competition to flourish;
the government has also made concerted efforts to take advantage of
Taiwan’s strengths in the development of high-tech, export-oriented
industries to encourage and enable the rapid adoption of advanced
telecom platforms, while simultaneously leveraging the same
telecoms infrastructure to push even further ahead with the
country's industrial development plans; Taiwan has one of the
highest teledensities in the region; while fixed-line subscriber
numbers are trending downwards, the rate of decline has been slowed
by the major fixed-line provider investing strongly in building out
a widespread fiber network to allow customers to maintain a
terrestrial voice connection as part of a fixed broadband package;
fiber is the dominant platform in Taiwan’s fixed broadband market;
cable services have retained an unusually strong following thanks
to the success of cable providers in delivering competitive cable
TV and telephony services as a way to get around Chunghwa Telecom’s
control of the last mile for its copper and fiber networks; Taiwan
also has high penetration rates in its mobile and mobile broadband
segments, growth in both markets is almost at a standstill because
the country reached 100% penetration very early on – way back when
GSM was first introduced, in mobile’s case; the MNOs moved quickly
to roll out 4G and 5G networks and services in rapid succession,
but subscriber numbers (and market share) has barely changed; the
improved quality and performance available with the new platforms
will drive increased usage and ARPU; fierce competition following
the launch of 4G saw the opposite happen, with price wars causing
telco revenues to fall instead; it is possible that the same
problem can be avoided with 5G allowing Taiwan to reach the target
of 50% of subscribers on 5G by mid-2023 (2022)<br/>

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
