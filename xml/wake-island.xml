   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Wake Island was probably visited by Micronesian and Polynesian
settlers, and oral legends tell of periodic voyages to the islands
by people from the Marshall Islands. Wake Island was uninhabited
when Spanish explorer Alvaro de Mendana de NEYRA became the first
European to see it in 1568 and still had no human inhabitants when
English captain Samuel WAKE sailed by it in 1796. The United States
Exploring Expedition visited the island in 1841 and the US annexed
it in 1899 to use as a cable and refueling station between its
newly acquired Pacific territories of Hawaii, the Philippines, and
Guam. In the 1930s, Pan American Airways built facilities on Wake
Island so that it could be used as a stopover for flights from the
US to China. In January 1941, the US began to install military
assets on Wake Island and in early December of that year, Japan
attacked Wake Island, capturing it by the end of the month after a
heroic resistance. Japan held Wake Island until the end of World
War II, and in 1946, commercial airlines once again used Wake
Island as a refueling stop.

In 1973, the Marshall Islands claimed Wake Island based on the oral
legends, although the US has not recognized these claims. In 1974,
the US military took exclusive control of the islandâ€™s airstrip and
restricted visitors. In 1978, Bikini Islanders from the Marshall
Islands, who were evacuated in the 1950s and 1960s because of US
nuclear tests, considered rehoming on Wake Island, but the US
military rejected that plan. Since the 1970s, the island has been
important for missile defense testing. In 2009, Wake Island was
included in the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National
Monument.</subsection>
