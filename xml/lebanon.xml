   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">As a result of its location at the crossroads of three
continents, the area that is modern-day Lebanon is rich in cultural
and religious diversity. This region was subject to various foreign
conquests for much of its history, including by the Romans, Arabs,
and Ottomans. Following World War I, France acquired a mandate over
the northern portion of the former Ottoman Empire province of
Syria. From it the French demarcated the region of Lebanon in 1920,
and it gained independence in 1943. Since then, Lebanon has
experienced periods of political turmoil interspersed with
prosperity built on its historical position as a regional center
for finance and trade, although that status has significantly
diminished since the beginning of Lebanon’s economic crisis in
2019, which includes simultaneous currency, debt, and banking
crises. The country's 1975-90 civil war, which resulted in an
estimated 120,000 fatalities, was followed by years of social and
political instability. Sectarianism is a key element of Lebanese
political life. Neighboring Syria has historically influenced
Lebanon's foreign and domestic policies, and its military occupied
Lebanon from 1976 until 2005. Hizballah - a major Lebanese
political party, militia, and US-designated foreign terrorist
organization - and Israel continued attacks and counterattacks
against each other after Syria's withdrawal, and fought a brief war
in 2006. Lebanon's borders with Syria and Israel remain
unresolved.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Lebanon’s economic crisis
has had a dire effect on the country’s telecom services; although
some progress has been made with developing 5G, the poor economic
conditions have contributed to an erratic electricity supply and a
lack of fuel to maintain generators; this has meant that internet
services to areas of the country are not available on a regular
basis, frustrating all those who depend on stable connectivity, and
stalling business growth; adding to the difficulties are the
combined stresses of the pandemic and the political crisis; a
caretaker cabinet in September 2021 made way for a new government
though there is little confidence on the ground that
sectarian-based political horse-trading will give way to
responsible governing to improve the lot of the stressed populace

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

ash-Sham (ISIS) and al-Qa’ida terrorist groups and maintaining
stability along its volatile border with Israel, where the
Iranian-backed and Lebanon-based terrorist group Hizballah
conducted a war with Israel in 2006 and tensions remained high,
including occasional armed skirmishes; the military also faced a
financial crisis as government debt and national economic
difficulties undercut its ability to fully pay and supply
personnel, which has sparked domestic and international fears that
the armed forces may disintegrate<br/>
         <br/>
the United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon (UNIFIL) has operated
in the country since 1978, originally under UNSCRs 425 and 426 to
confirm Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, restore international
peace and security, and assist the Lebanese Government in restoring
its effective authority in the area; following the July-August 2006
war, the UN Security Council adopted resolution 1701 enhancing
UNIFIL and deciding that in addition to the original mandate, it
would, among other things, monitor the cessation of hostilities,
support the Lebanese Armed Forces as they deployed throughout the
south of Lebanon, and provide assistance for humanitarian access
for civilians and the return of displaced persons; UNIFIL had
approximately 9,500 military personnel deployed in the country as
of 2022 (2022)</subsection>
