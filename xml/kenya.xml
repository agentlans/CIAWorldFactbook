   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Trade centers such as Mombasa have existed along the Kenyan and
Tanzanian coastlines, known as the Land of Zanj, since at least the
2nd century. These centers traded with the outside world, including
China, India, Indonesia, the Middle East, North Africa, and Persia.
By around the 9th century, the mix of Africans, Arabs, and Persians
who lived and traded there became known as Swahili ("people of the
coast") with a distinct language (KiSwahili) and culture. The
Portuguese arrived in the 1490s and, using Mombasa as a base,
sought to monopolize trade in the Indian Ocean. The Portuguese were
pushed out in the late 1600s by the combined forces of Oman and
Pate, an island off the coast. In 1890, Germany and the UK divided
up the region, with the UK taking the north and the Germans the
south, including present-day Tanzania, Burundi, and Rwanda. The
British established the East Africa Protectorate in 1895, which in
1920 was converted into a colony and named Kenya after its highest
mountain. Numerous political disputes between the colony and the UK
subsequently led to the violent Mau Mau Uprising, which began in
1952, and the eventual declaration of independence in 1963.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Kenya has experienced dramatic population growth since the
mid-20th century as a result of its high birth rate and its
declining mortality rate. Almost 40% of Kenyans are under the age
of 15 as of 2020 because of sustained high fertility, early
marriage and childbearing, and an unmet need for family planning.
Kenya’s persistent rapid population growth strains the labor
market, social services, arable land, and natural resources.
Although Kenya in 1967 was the first Sub-Saharan country to launch
a nationwide family planning program, progress in reducing the
birth rate has largely stalled since the late 1990s, when the
government decreased its support for family planning to focus on
the HIV epidemic. Government commitment and international technical
support spurred Kenyan contraceptive use, decreasing the fertility
rate (children per woman) from about 8 in the late 1970s to less
than 5 children twenty years later, but it has plateaued at about 3
children as of 2022.Kenya is a source of emigrants and a host country for refugees.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Kenyans pursued higher education in the UK
because of colonial ties, but as British immigration rules
tightened, the US, the then Soviet Union, and Canada became
attractive study destinations. Kenya’s stagnant economy and
political problems during the 1980s and 1990s led to an outpouring
of Kenyan students and professionals seeking permanent
opportunities in the West and southern Africa. Nevertheless,
Kenya’s relative stability since its independence in 1963 has
attracted hundreds of thousands of refugees escaping violent
conflicts in neighboring countries; Kenya was sheltering nearly
280,000 Somali refugees as of 2022.</subsection>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>
