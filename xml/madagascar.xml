   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Madagascar was one of the last major habitable landmasses on
earth settled by humans. While there is some evidence of human
presence on the island in the millennia B.C., large-scale
settlement began between A.D. 350 and 550 with settlers from
present-day Indonesia. The island attracted Arab and Persian
traders as early as the 7th century, and migrants from Africa
arrived around A.D. 1000. Madagascar was a pirate stronghold during
the late 17th and early 18th centuries, and served as a slave
trading center into the 19th century. From the 16th to the late
19th century, a native Merina Kingdom dominated much of Madagascar.
The island was conquered by the French in 1896 who made it a
colony; independence was regained in 1960.

During 1992-93, free presidential and National Assembly elections
were held ending 17 years of single-party rule. In 1997, in the
second presidential race, Didier RATSIRAKA, the leader during the
1970s and 1980s, returned to the presidency. The 2001 presidential
election was contested between the followers of Didier RATSIRAKA
and Marc RAVALOMANANA, nearly causing secession of half of the
country. In 2002, the High Constitutional Court announced
RAVALOMANANA the winner. RAVALOMANANA won a second term in 2006
but, following protests in 2009, handed over power to the military,
which then conferred the presidency on the mayor of Antananarivo,
Andry RAJOELINA, in what amounted to a coup d'etat. Following a
lengthy mediation process led by the Southern African Development
Community, Madagascar held UN-supported presidential and
parliamentary elections in 2013. Former de facto finance minister
Hery RAJAONARIMAMPIANINA won a runoff election in December 2013 and
was inaugurated in January 2014. In January 2019, RAJOELINA was
declared the winner of a runoff election against RAVALOMANANA; both
RATSIRAKA and RAJAONARIMAMPIANINA also ran in the first round of
the election, which took place in November 2018.</subsection>

(2021 est.)</subsection>
      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Madagascar’s youthful population – nearly 60% are under the age
of 25 as of 2020 – and moderately high total fertility rate of more
than 3.6 children per woman ensures that the Malagasy population
will continue its rapid growth trajectory for the foreseeable
future. The population is predominantly rural and poor; chronic
malnutrition is prevalent, and large families are the norm. Many
young Malagasy girls are withdrawn from school, marry early (often
pressured to do so by their parents), and soon begin having
children. Early childbearing, coupled with Madagascar’s widespread
poverty and lack of access to skilled health care providers during
delivery, increases the risk of death and serious health problems
for young mothers and their babies.Child marriage perpetuates gender inequality and is prevalent
among the poor, the uneducated, and rural households – as of 2018,
40% of Malagasy women aged 20 to 24 were married. Although the
legal age for marriage is 18, parental consent is often given for
earlier marriages or the law is flouted, especially in rural areas
that make up approximately 60% of the country. Forms of arranged
marriage whereby young girls are married to older men in exchange
for oxen or money are traditional. If a union does not work out, a
girl can be placed in another marriage, but the dowry paid to her
family diminishes with each unsuccessful marriage.Madagascar’s population consists of 18 main ethnic groups, all
of whom speak the same Malagasy language. Most Malagasy are
multi-ethnic, however, reflecting the island’s diversity of
settlers and historical contacts (see Background). Madagascar’s
legacy of hierarchical societies practicing domestic slavery (most
notably the Merina Kingdom of the 16th to the 19th century) is
evident today in persistent class tension, with some ethnic groups
maintaining a caste system. Slave descendants are vulnerable to
unequal access to education and jobs, despite Madagascar’s
constitutional guarantee of free compulsory primary education and
its being party to several international conventions on human
rights. Historical distinctions also remain between central
highlanders and coastal people.</subsection>
