   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Madagascar was one of the last major habitable landmasses on
earth settled by humans. While there is some evidence of human
presence on the island in the millennia B.C., large-scale
settlement began between A.D. 350 and 550 with settlers from
present-day Indonesia. The island attracted Arab and Persian
traders as early as the 7th century, and migrants from Africa
arrived around A.D. 1000. Madagascar was a pirate stronghold during
the late 17th and early 18th centuries, and served as a slave
trading center into the 19th century. From the 16th to the late
19th century, a native Merina Kingdom dominated much of Madagascar.
The island was conquered by the French in 1896 who made it a
colony; independence was regained in 1960.<br/>
         <br/>
During 1992-93, free presidential and National Assembly elections
were held ending 17 years of single-party rule. In 1997, in the
second presidential race, Didier RATSIRAKA, the leader during the
1970s and 1980s, returned to the presidency. The 2001 presidential
election was contested between the followers of Didier RATSIRAKA
and Marc RAVALOMANANA, nearly causing secession of half of the
country. In 2002, the High Constitutional Court announced
RAVALOMANANA the winner. RAVALOMANANA won a second term in 2006
but, following protests in 2009, handed over power to the military,
which then conferred the presidency on the mayor of Antananarivo,
Andry RAJOELINA, in what amounted to a coup d'etat. Following a
lengthy mediation process led by the Southern African Development
Community, Madagascar held UN-supported presidential and
parliamentary elections in 2013. Former de facto finance minister
Hery RAJAONARIMAMPIANINA won a runoff election in December 2013 and
was inaugurated in January 2014. In January 2019, RAJOELINA was
declared the winner of a runoff election against RAVALOMANANA; both
RATSIRAKA and RAJAONARIMAMPIANINA also ran in the first round of
the election, which took place in November 2018.</subsection>

(2021 est.)</subsection>
      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Madagascar’s youthful population – nearly 60% are under the age
of 25 as of 2020 – and moderately high total fertility rate of more
than 3.6 children per woman ensures that the Malagasy population
will continue its rapid growth trajectory for the foreseeable
future. The population is predominantly rural and poor; chronic
malnutrition is prevalent, and large families are the norm. Many
young Malagasy girls are withdrawn from school, marry early (often
pressured to do so by their parents), and soon begin having
children. Early childbearing, coupled with Madagascar’s widespread
poverty and lack of access to skilled health care providers during
delivery, increases the risk of death and serious health problems
for young mothers and their babies.Child marriage perpetuates gender inequality and is prevalent
among the poor, the uneducated, and rural households – as of 2018,
40% of Malagasy women aged 20 to 24 were married. Although the
legal age for marriage is 18, parental consent is often given for
earlier marriages or the law is flouted, especially in rural areas
that make up approximately 60% of the country. Forms of arranged
marriage whereby young girls are married to older men in exchange
for oxen or money are traditional. If a union does not work out, a
girl can be placed in another marriage, but the dowry paid to her
family diminishes with each unsuccessful marriage.Madagascar’s population consists of 18 main ethnic groups, all
of whom speak the same Malagasy language. Most Malagasy are
multi-ethnic, however, reflecting the island’s diversity of
settlers and historical contacts (see Background). Madagascar’s
legacy of hierarchical societies practicing domestic slavery (most
notably the Merina Kingdom of the 16th to the 19th century) is
evident today in persistent class tension, with some ethnic groups
maintaining a caste system. Slave descendants are vulnerable to
unequal access to education and jobs, despite Madagascar’s
constitutional guarantee of free compulsory primary education and
its being party to several international conventions on human
rights. Historical distinctions also remain between central
highlanders and coastal people.</subsection>

Africa; Madagascar is currently considered a high risk to travelers
for circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV);
vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) is a strain of the weakened
poliovirus that was initially included in oral polio vaccine (OPV)
and that has changed over time and behaves more like the wild
or naturally occurring virus; this means it can be spread more
easily to people who are unvaccinated against polio and who come in
contact with the stool or respiratory secretions, such as from a
sneeze, of an “infected” person who received oral polio vaccine;
the CDC recommends that before any international travel, anyone
unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated, or with an unknown polio
vaccination status should complete the routine polio vaccine
series; before travel to any high-risk destination, the CDC
recommends that adults who previously completed the full, routine
polio vaccine series receive a single, lifetime booster dose of

- according to the latest May 2022 analysis, the prevalence of
food insecurity in the southern regions is projected to peak at 2.1
million people by December 2022 until at least March 2023; overall,
the number of people requiring humanitarian assistance by the end
of 2022 is expected to be about 30 percent higher compared to the
peak number in 2021; the poor food security situation is mainly the
consequence of six consecutive poor agricultural seasons that
culminated in very tight food supplies for rural households and
curbed incomes from crop sales; high rates of poverty and increased
prices of essential food commodities, combined with a high reliance
on market supplies due to low harvests for own consumption, are
also contributing to the high rates of food insecurity across the

Madagascar have benefited from intensifying competition between the
main operators; there have been positive developments with the
country’s link to international submarine cables, particularly the
METISS cable connecting to South Africa and Mauritius; in addition,
the country’s connection to the Africa-1 cable, expected in late
2023, will provide it with links to Kenya, Djibouti, countries in
north and south Africa, as well Pakistan, the UAE, Saudi Arabia,
and France; a national fiber backbone has been implemented
connecting the major cities; in addition, the government has
progressed with its five-year plan to develop a digital platform
running to 2024; various schemes within the program have been
managed by a unit within the President’s office; penetration rates
in all market sectors remain below the average for the African
region, and so there remains considerable growth potential; much
progress was made in 2020, stimulated by the particular conditions
related to the pandemic, which encouraged greater use of voice and
data services (2022)<br/>

(2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
