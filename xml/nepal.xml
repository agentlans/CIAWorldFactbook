   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">During the late 18th-early 19th centuries, the principality of
Gorkha united many of the other principalities and states of the
sub-Himalayan region into a Nepali Kingdom. Nepal retained its
independence following the Anglo-Nepalese War of 1814-16 and the
subsequent peace treaty laid the foundations for two centuries of
amicable relations between Britain and Nepal. (The Brigade of
Gurkhas continues to serve in the British Army to the present day.)
In 1951, the Nepali monarch ended the century-old system of rule by
hereditary premiers and instituted a cabinet system that brought
political parties into the government. That arrangement lasted
until 1960, when political parties were again banned, but was
reinstated in 1990 with the establishment of a multiparty democracy
within the framework of a constitutional monarchy.An insurgency led by Maoists broke out in 1996. During the
ensuing 10-year civil war between Maoist and government forces, the
monarchy dissolved the cabinet and parliament and re-assumed
absolute power in 2002, after the crown prince massacred the royal
family in 2001. A peace accord in 2006 led to the promulgation of
an interim constitution in 2007. Following a nationwide Constituent
Assembly (CA) election in 2008, the newly formed CA declared Nepal
a federal democratic republic, abolished the monarchy, and elected
the country's first president. After the CA failed to draft a
constitution by a 2012 deadline set by the Supreme Court,
then-Prime Minister Baburam BHATTARAI dissolved the CA. Months of
negotiations ensued until 2013 when the major political parties
agreed to create an interim government headed by then-Chief Justice
Khil Raj REGMI with a mandate to hold elections for a new CA.
Elections were held in 2013, in which the Nepali Congress (NC) won
the largest share of seats in the CA and in 2014 formed a coalition
government with the second-place Communist Party of Nepal-Unified
Marxist-Leninist (UML) with NC President Sushil KOIRALA serving as
prime minister. Nepal's new constitution came into effect in 2015,
at which point the CA became the Parliament. Khagda Prasad Sharma
OLI served as the first post-constitution prime minister from 2015
to 2016. OLI resigned ahead of a no-confidence motion against him,
and Parliament elected Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist (CPN-M)
leader Pushpa Kamal DAHAL (aka "Prachanda") prime minister. The
constitution provided for a transitional period during which three
sets of elections – local, provincial, and national – needed to
take place. The first local elections in 20 years occurred in three
phases between May and September 2017, and state and federal
elections proceeded in two phases in November and December 2017.
The parties headed by OLI and DAHAL ran in coalition and swept the
parliamentary elections, and OLI, who led the larger of the two
parties, was sworn in as prime minister in February 2018. In May
2018, OLI and DAHAL announced the merger of their parties - the UML
and CPN-M - to establish the Nepal Communist Party (NCP), which
headed the government for roughly two years before infighting led
the party to split. OLI from late 2020 sought to dissolve
parliament and hold elections. The supreme court in July 2021
declared OLI's efforts unconstitutional and called for an
appointment of the opposition-supported NC leader Sher Bahadur
DEUBA as prime minister. </subsection>

      <subsection title="Flag description">crimson red with a blue border around the unique shape of two
overlapping right triangles; the smaller, upper triangle bears a
white stylized moon and the larger, lower triangle displays a white
12-pointed sun; the color red represents the rhododendron (Nepal's
national flower) and is a sign of victory and bravery, the blue
border signifies peace and harmony; the two right triangles are a
combination of two single pennons (pennants) that originally
symbolized the Himalaya Mountains while their charges represented
the families of the king (upper) and the prime minister, but today
they are understood to denote Hinduism and Buddhism, the country's
two main religions; the moon represents the serenity of the
Nepalese people and the shade and cool weather in the Himalayas,
while the sun depicts the heat and higher temperatures of the lower
parts of Nepal; the moon and the sun are also said to express the
hope that the nation will endure as long as these heavenly

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: in relation to its telecom
sector, Nepal has several topographical and economic constraints
which have impeded efforts to expand network infrastructure and
improve the quality of service for end-users; the fixed line market
remains underdeveloped, and as a result most traffic is channeled
via mobile networks; fixed broadband penetration remains very low,
though to address this the government has initiated several
programs as part of the Digital Nepal Framework and the wider
Optical Fiber Backbone Network Expansion Project, started in 2012;
supported by the Rural Telecommunications Development Fund, the
programs include building out fiber backbone infrastructure and
using this to provide broadband to schools and community centers
nationally; telcos have also invested in fiber networks, and
competition in the market is intensifying; cheap fiber-based
services launched in mid-2021 prompted responses from other ISPs to
provide faster and more competitively priced offers; Nepal’s mobile
market is relatively developed, with a focus on LTE; in 2021, the
regulator considered a range of spectrum bands which could be used
for 5G (2021)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line less than 2 per 100 persons
and mobile-cellular nearly 131 per 100 persons (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 977; Nepal, China
and Tibet connected across borders with underground and
all-dielectric self-supporting (ADSS) fiber-optic cables;
radiotelephone communications; microwave and fiber landlines to
India; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Indian Ocean)
(2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

the British began to recruit Nepalese citizens (Gurkhas) into the
East India Company Army during the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814-1816);
the Gurkhas subsequently were brought into the British Indian Army
and by 1914, there were 10 Gurkha regiments, collectively known as
the Gurkha Brigade; following the partition of India in 1947, an
agreement between Nepal, India, and Great Britain allowed for the
transfer of the 10 regiments from the British Indian Army to the
separate British and Indian armies; four regiments were transferred
to the British Army, where they have since served continuously as
the Brigade of Gurkhas; six Gurkha (aka Gorkha in India) regiments
went to the new Indian Army; a seventh regiment was later added;
Gurkhas are also recruited into the Singaporean Police and a
special guard in the Sultanate of Brunei known as the Gurkha
Reserve Unit (2022)</subsection>
