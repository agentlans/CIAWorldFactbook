   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Polynesians were the first inhabitants of the Pitcairn Islands,
but the islands were uninhabited by the time they were discovered
by Europeans in 1606. Pitcairn Island was rediscovered by British
explorer Philip CARTERET in 1767, although he incorrectly plotted
the coordinates. In 1789, Fletcher CHRISTIAN led a mutiny on the
HMS Bounty and after several months of searching for Pitcairn
Island, he landed on it with eight other mutineers and their
Tahitian companions. They lived in isolation and evaded detection
by English authorities until 1808, by which point only one man, 10
women, and 23 children remained. In 1831, with the population
growing too big for the island - there were 87 people - the British
attempted to move all the islanders to Tahiti, but they were soon
returned to Pitcairn Island. The island became an official British
colony in 1838 and in 1856, the British again determined that the
population of 193 was too high and relocated all of the residents
to Norfolk Island. Several families returned in 1858 and 1864,
bringing the island’s population to 43, and almost all of the
island’s current population are descendants of these returnees. In
1887, the entire population converted to the Seventh Day Adventist
faith.

The UK annexed the nearby islands of Henderson, Oeno, and Ducie in
1902 and incorporated them into the Pitcairn Islands colony in
1938, although all three are uninhabited. The population peaked at
233 in 1937 as outmigration, primarily to New Zealand, has thinned
the population. Only two children were born between 1986 and 2012,
and in 2005, a couple became the first new outsiders to obtain
citizenship in more than a century. (The current population is
below 50.) Since 2013, the Pitcairn Islands has tried to attract
new migrants but has had no applicants because it requires
prospective migrants to front significant sums of money and
prohibits employment during a two-year trial period, at which point
the local council can deny long-term resident status.</subsection>
