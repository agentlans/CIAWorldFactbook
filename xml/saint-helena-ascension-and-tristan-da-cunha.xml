   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Saint Helena is a British Overseas Territory consisting of Saint
Helena and Ascension Islands, and the island group of Tristan da
Cunha.Saint Helena: Uninhabited when first discovered
by the Portuguese in 1502, Saint Helena was garrisoned by the
British during the 17th century. It acquired fame as the place of
Napoleon BONAPARTE's exile from 1815 until his death in 1821, but
its importance as a port of call declined after the opening of the
Suez Canal in 1869. During the Anglo-Boer War in South Africa,
several thousand Boer prisoners were confined on the island between
1900 and 1903.Saint Helena is one of the most remote populated places in the
world. The British Government committed to building an airport on
Saint Helena in 2005. After more than a decade of delays and
construction, a commercial air service to South Africa via Namibia
was inaugurated in October of 2017. The weekly service to Saint
Helena from Johannesburg via Windhoek in Namibia takes just over
six hours (including the refueling stop in Windhoek) and replaces
the mail ship that had made a five-day journey to the island every
three weeks.Ascension Island: This barren and uninhabited
island was discovered and named by the Portuguese in 1503. The
British garrisoned the island in 1815 to prevent a rescue of
NAPOLEON from Saint Helena. It served as a provisioning station for
the Royal Navy's West Africa Squadron on anti-slavery patrol. The
island remained under Admiralty control until 1922, when it became
a dependency of Saint Helena. During World War II, the UK permitted
the US to construct an airfield on Ascension in support of
transatlantic flights to Africa and anti-submarine operations in
the South Atlantic. In the 1960s the island became an important
space tracking station for the US. In 1982, Ascension was an
essential staging area for British forces during the Falklands War.
It remains a critical refueling point in the air-bridge from the UK
to the South Atlantic.The island hosts one of four dedicated ground antennas that
assist in the operation of the Global Positioning System (GPS)
navigation system (the others are on Diego Garcia (British Indian
Ocean Territory), Kwajalein (Marshall Islands), and at Cape
Canaveral, Florida (US)). NASA and the US Air Force also operate a
Meter-Class Autonomous Telescope (MCAT) on Ascension as part of the
deep space surveillance system for tracking orbital debris, which
can be a hazard to spacecraft and astronauts.Tristan da Cunha: The island group consists of
Tristan da Cunha, Nightingale, Inaccessible, and Gough Islands.
Tristan da Cunha, named after its Portuguese discoverer (1506), was
garrisoned by the British in 1816 to prevent any attempt to rescue
NAPOLEON from Saint Helena. Gough and Inaccessible Islands have
been designated World Heritage Sites. South Africa leases a site
for a meteorological station on Gough Island.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">The vast majority of the population of Saint Helena, Ascension,
and Tristan da Cunha live on Saint Helena. Ascension has no
indigenous or permanent residents and is inhabited only by persons
contracted to work on the island (mainly with the UK and US
military or in the space and communications industries) or their
dependents, while Tristan da Cunha – the main island in a small
archipelago – has fewer than 300 residents. The population of Saint
Helena consists of the descendants of 17th century British sailors
and settlers from the East India Company, African slaves, and
indentured servants and laborers from India, Indonesia, and China.
Most of the population of Ascension are Saint Helenians, Britons,
and Americans, while that of Tristan da Cunha descends from
shipwrecked sailors and Saint Helenians.Change in Saint Helena’s population size is driven by net
outward migration. Since the 1980s, Saint Helena’s population
steadily has shrunk and aged as the birth rate has decreased and
many working-age residents left for better opportunities elsewhere.
The restoration of British citizenship in 2002 accelerated family
emigration; from 1998 to 2008 alone, population declined by about
20%.In the 2010s, the population experienced some temporary growth,
as foreigners and returning Saint Helenians, came to build an
international airport, but numbers faded as the project reached
completion and workers departed. With the airport fully
operational, increased access to the remote island has the
potential to boost tourism and fishing, provide more jobs for Saint
Helenians domestically, and could encourage some ex-patriots to
return home. In the meantime, however, Saint Helena, Ascension, and
Tristan da Cunha have to contend with the needs of an aging
population. The elderly population of the islands has risen from an
estimated 9.4% in 1998 to 18% in 2022.</subsection>

sighted the island on the Feast Day of the Ascension; Tristan da
Cunha was discovered in 1506 by Portuguese explorer Tristao da

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
