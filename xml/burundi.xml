   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Established in the 1600s, the Burundi Kingdom has had borders
similar to those of modern Burundi since the 1800s. Burundi’s two
major ethnic groups, the majority Hutu and minority Tutsi, share a
common language and culture and largely lived in peaceful
cohabitation under Tutsi monarchs in pre-colonial Burundi.
Regional, class, and clan distinctions contributed to social status
in the Burundi Kingdom, yielding a complex class structure. German
colonial rule in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and Belgian
rule after World War I preserved Burundi’s monarchy. Seeking to
simplify administration, Belgian colonial officials reduced the
number of chiefdoms and eliminated most Hutu chiefs from positions
of power. In 1961, the Burundian Tutsi king’s oldest son, Louis
RWAGASORE was murdered by a competing political faction shortly
before he was set to become prime minister, triggering increased
political competition that contributed to later instability.
Burundi gained its independence from Belgium in 1962 as the Kingdom
of Burundi.Revolution in neighboring Rwanda stoked ethnic polarization as
the Tutsi increasingly feared violence and loss of political power.
A failed Hutu-led coup in 1965 triggered a purge of Hutu officials
and set the stage for Tutsi officers to overthrow the monarchy in
1966 and establish a Tutsi-dominated republic. A Hutu rebellion in
1972 that resulted in the death of several thousand Tutsi civilians
sparked a brutal crackdown on Hutu civilians by the Tutsi-led
military, which ultimately killed 100,000-200,000 people.
International pressure led to a new constitution in 1992 and
democratic elections in June 1993. Burundi's first democratically
elected president, Hutu Melchior NDADAYE, was assassinated in
October 1993 after only 100 days in office by Tutsi military
officers fearing Hutu domination, sparking a civil war. His
successor, Cyprien NTARYAMIRA, died when the Rwandan president’s
plane he was traveling on was shot down in April 1994, which
triggered the Rwandan genocide and further entrenched ethnic
conflict in Burundi. The internationally brokered Arusha Agreement,
signed in 2000, and subsequent cease-fire agreements with armed
movements ended the 1993-2005 civil war. Burundi’s second
democratic elections were held in 2005, resulting in the election
of Pierre NKURUNZIZA as president. He was reelected in 2010 and
again in 2015 after a controversial court decision allowed him to
circumvent a term limit. President Evariste NDAYISHIMIYE - from
NKURUNZIZA’s ruling party - was elected in 2020.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Burundi is a densely populated country with a high population
growth rate, factors that combined with land scarcity and poverty
place a large share of its population at risk of food insecurity.
About 90% of the population relies on subsistence agriculture.
Subdivision of land to sons, and redistribution to returning
refugees, results in smaller, overworked, and less-productive
plots. Food shortages, poverty, and a lack of clean water
contribute to a 60% chronic malnutrition rate among children. A
lack of reproductive health services has prevented a significant
reduction in Burundi’s maternal mortality and fertility rates,
which are both among the world’s highest. With almost two-thirds of
its population under the age of 25 and a birth rate of about 5
children per woman as of 2022, Burundi’s population will continue
to expand rapidly for decades to come, putting additional strain on
a poor country.Historically, migration flows into and out of Burundi have
consisted overwhelmingly of refugees from violent conflicts. In the
last decade, more than a half million Burundian refugees returned
home from neighboring countries, mainly Tanzania. Reintegrating the
returnees has been problematic due to their prolonged time in
exile, land scarcity, poor infrastructure, poverty, and
unemployment. Repatriates and existing residents (including
internally displaced persons) compete for limited land and other
resources. To further complicate matters, international aid
organizations reduced their assistance because they no longer
classified Burundi as a post-conflict country. Conditions
deteriorated when renewed violence erupted in April 2015, causing
another outpouring of refugees. In addition to refugee
out-migration, Burundi has hosted thousands of refugees from
neighboring countries, mostly from the Democratic Republic of the
Congo and lesser numbers from Rwanda.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">
         <note title="general assessment">Burundi provides an attractive telecom market given its high population density and existing low subscription rates for all services; one downside for investors is that the country has a very low economic output, disposable income is also very low, and fixed-line infrastructure is poor outside the main urban areas; this is a greater motivation for investors to focus on improving mobile networks than in expanding fixed-line infrastructure; to overcome difficulties associated with the poor telecom infrastructure, the government has supported a number of prominent telcos building a national fiber backbone network; this network offers onward connectivity to submarine cable infrastructure landings in Kenya and Tanzania; the first sections of this network were switched on in early 2014, and additional provinces have since been connected; in addition, the government in early 2018 kick-started the Burundi Broadband project, which aims to deliver national connectivity by 2025; based on this improved infrastructure the government and ITU have developed an ICT strategy to make use of telecoms to promote the country’s socio-economic development through to 2028; progress made by Tanzania with its own national backbone network has benefited Burundi, which has been provided with onward connectivity to most countries in the region; International bandwidth capacity has continued to increase in recent years, including a 38% increase in the nine months to September 2021, resulting in lower retail prices for consumers; two of the mobile operators have launched 3G and LTE services to capitalize on the growing demand for internet access; the number of mobile subscribers increased 7% in the third quarter of 2021, quarter-on-quarter; similar growth is expected for the next two years at least, which will help bring the mobile level closer to the average for the region (2022)</note>
         <note title="domestic">telephone density one of the lowest in the world; fixed-line connections stand at less than 1 per 100 persons; mobile-cellular usage is about 56 per 100 persons (2020)</note>
         <note title="international">country code - 257; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Indian Ocean); the government, supported by the World Bank, has backed a joint venture with a number of prominent telecoms to build a national fiber backbone network, offering onward connectivity to submarine cable infrastructure landings in Kenya and Tanzania (2019)</note>
         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>
