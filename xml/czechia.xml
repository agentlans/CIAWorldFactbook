   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">At the close of World War I, the Czechs and Slovaks of the
former Austro-Hungarian Empire merged to form Czechoslovakia, a
parliamentarian democracy. During the interwar years, having
rejected a federal system, the new country's predominantly Czech
leaders were frequently preoccupied with meeting the increasingly
strident demands of other ethnic minorities within the republic,
most notably the Slovaks, the Sudeten Germans, and the Ruthenians
(Ukrainians). On the eve of World War II, Nazi Germany occupied the
territory that today comprises Czechia, and Slovakia became an
independent state allied with Germany. After the war, a reunited
but truncated Czechoslovakia (less Ruthenia) fell within the Soviet
sphere of influence when the pro-Soviet Communist party staged a
coup in February 1948. In 1968, an invasion by fellow Warsaw Pact
troops ended the efforts of the country's leaders to liberalize
communist rule and create "socialism with a human face," ushering
in a period of repression known as "normalization." The peaceful
"Velvet Revolution" swept the Communist Party from power at the end
of 1989 and inaugurated a return to democratic rule and a market
economy. On 1 January 1993, the country underwent a nonviolent
"velvet divorce" into its two national components, the Czech
Republic and Slovakia. The Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999 and
the European Union in 2004. The country formally added the
short-form name Czechia in 2016, while also continuing to use the
full form name, the Czech Republic.</subsection>

downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
