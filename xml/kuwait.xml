   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Kuwait has been ruled by the AL-SABAH dynasty since the 18th
century. The threat of Ottoman invasion in 1899 prompted Amir
Mubarak AL-SABAH to seek protection from Britain, ceding foreign
and defense responsibility to Britain until 1961, when the country
attained its independence. Kuwait was attacked and overrun by Iraq
in August 1990. Following several weeks of aerial bombardment, a
US-led UN coalition began a ground assault in February 1991 that
liberated Kuwait in four days. In 1992, the Amir reconstituted the
parliament that he had dissolved in 1986. Amid the 2010-11
uprisings and protests across the Arab world, stateless Arabs,
known as Bidoon, staged small protests in early 2011 demanding
citizenship, jobs, and other benefits available to Kuwaiti
nationals. Other demographic groups, notably Islamists and Kuwaitis
from tribal backgrounds, soon joined the growing protest movements,
which culminated in late 2011 with the resignation of the prime
minister amidst allegations of corruption. Demonstrations renewed
in late 2012 in response to an amiri decree amending the electoral
law that lessened the voting power of the tribal blocs.<br/>
         <br/>
An opposition coalition of Sunni Islamists, tribal populists, and
some liberals, largely boycotted legislative elections in 2012 and
2013, which ushered in a legislature more amenable to the
government's agenda. Faced with the prospect of painful subsidy
cuts, oppositionists and independents actively participated in the
November 2016 election, winning nearly half of the seats, but a
cohesive opposition alliance largely ceased to exist with the 2016
election and the opposition became increasingly factionalized.
Since coming to power in 2006, the Amir has dissolved the National
Assembly on seven occasions (the Constitutional Court annulled the
Assembly elections in June 2012 and again in June 2013) and
shuffled the cabinet over a dozen times, usually citing political
stagnation and gridlock between the legislature and the
government.<br/>
         <br/>
The current Amir, who assumed his role in 2020, launched a
"National Dialogue" in September 2021 meant to resolve political
gridlock. As part of the "National Dialogue," the Amir pardoned
several opposition figures who had been living in exile, and they
returned to Kuwait. Legislative challenges remain, and the cabinet
was reshuffled in March 2022.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Kuwait’s telecom
infrastructure is well developed, with a focus on mobile
infrastructure and services; the telecom sector is important to the
country’s economy, and this will become more pronounced in coming
years as the economy is purposefully transitioned away from a
dependence on oil and gas to one which is increasingly
knowledge-based and focused on ICT and related services; the MNOs
have focused investment on 5G networks, which support and promote
the growth of data traffic; this in turn has been a catalyst for
revenue growth in recent quarters; while Kuwait’s mobile sector
shows considerable progress; the country’s fixed broadband system
is the lowest in the region; the government has stepped up efforts
to build up fixed broadband networks, and ultimately this sector
offers a potential future growth opportunity; improvements to the
fixed broadband infrastructure will help develop sectors such as
e-commerce, along with smart infrastructure developments, and tech
start-ups (2022)<br/>

Atlantic Ocean, and 2 Arabsat) (2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

Bedouin tribes, missed the window of opportunity to register for
nationality rights after Kuwait became independent in 1961 and were
classified as bidun (meaning "without"); since the 1980s Kuwait's
bidun have progressively lost their rights, including opportunities
for employment and education, amid official claims that they are
nationals of other countries who have destroyed their
identification documents in hopes of gaining Kuwaiti citizenship;
Kuwaiti authorities have delayed processing citizenship
applications and labeled biduns as "illegal residents," denying
them access to civil documentation, such as birth and marriage
certificates</subsection>
