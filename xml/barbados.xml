   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The island was uninhabited when first settled by the British in
1627. African slaves worked the sugar plantations established on
the island, which initially dominated the Caribbean sugar industry.
By 1720, Barbados was no longer a dominant force within the sugar
industry, having been surpassed by the Leeward Islands and Jamaica.
Slavery was abolished in 1834. The Barbadian economy remained
heavily dependent on sugar, rum, and molasses production through
most of the 20th century. The gradual introduction of social and
political reforms in the 1940s and 1950s led to complete
independence from the UK in 1966. In the 1990s, tourism and
manufacturing surpassed the sugar industry in economic importance.
Barbados became a republic on 30 November 2021, with the former
Governor-General Sandra MASON elected as the first president.
Barbados plans to create a new constitution in 2022.</subsection>
