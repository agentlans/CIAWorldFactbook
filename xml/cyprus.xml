   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">A former British colony, Cyprus became independent in 1960
following years of resistance to British rule. Tensions between the
Greek Cypriot majority and Turkish Cypriot minority communities
came to a head in December 1963, when violence broke out in the
capital of Nicosia. Despite the deployment of UN peacekeepers in
1964, sporadic intercommunal violence continued, forcing most
Turkish Cypriots into enclaves throughout the island. In 1974, a
Greek Government-sponsored attempt to overthrow the elected
president of Cyprus was met by military intervention from Turkey,
which soon controlled more than a third of the island. In 1983, the
Turkish Cypriot administered area declared itself the "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" ("TRNC"), but it is recognized only by
Turkey. An UN-mediated agreement, the Annan Plan, failed to win
approval by both communities in 2004. In February 2014, after a
hiatus of nearly two years, the leaders of the two communities
resumed formal discussions under UN auspices aimed at reuniting the
divided island. The most recent round of negotiations to reunify
the island were suspended in July 2017 after failure to
achieve a breakthrough. The entire island entered the EU on 1 May
2004, although the EU acquis - the body of common rights and
obligations - applies only to the areas under the internationally
recognized government, and is suspended in the "TRNC." However,
individual Turkish Cypriots able to document their eligibility for
Republic of Cyprus citizenship legally enjoy the same rights
accorded to other citizens of EU states.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Economy of the area administered by Turkish Cypriots">Economy - overview: Even though the whole of
the island is part of the EU, implementation of the EU "acquis
communautaire" has been suspended in the area administered by
Turkish Cypriots, known locally as the "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus" ("TRNC"), until political conditions permit the
reunification of the island. The market-based economy of the "TRNC"
is roughly one-fifth the size of its southern neighbor and is
likewise dominated by the service sector with a large portion of
the population employed by the government. In 2012 - the latest
year for which data are available - the services sector, which
includes the public sector, trade, tourism, and education,
contributed 58.7% to economic output. In the same year, light
manufacturing and agriculture contributed 2.7% and 6.2%,
respectively. Manufacturing is limited mainly to food and
beverages, furniture and fixtures, construction materials, metal
and non-metal products, textiles and clothing. The "TRNC" maintains
few economic ties with the Republic of Cyprus outside of trade in
construction materials. Since its creation, the "TRNC" has heavily
relied on financial assistance from Turkey, which supports the
"TRNC" defense, telecommunications, water and postal services. The
Turkish Lira is the preferred currency, though foreign currencies
are widely accepted in business transactions. The "TRNC" remains
vulnerable to the Turkish market and monetary policy because of its
use of the Turkish Lira. The "TRNC" weathered the European
financial crisis relatively unscathed - compared to the Republic of
Cyprus - because of the lack of financial sector development, the
health of the Turkish economy, and its separation from the rest of
the island. The "TRNC" economy experienced growth estimated at 2.8%
in 2013 and 2.3% in 2014 and is projected to grow 3.8% in
2015.;GDP (purchasing power parity): $1.829 billion

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Cyprus suffered from the
effects of the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, when the tourism sector
was essentially closed; during 2022, there have been adverse
effects caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has resulted
in a dramatic drop in the number of Russian tourists entering the
country; the mobile market is served by four mobile network
operators; the number of mobile subscribers fell in 2020, largely
the result of subscribers scaling back on multiple SIM cards as an
economic measure; the broadband market continues to develop
steadily, providing the country with one of the highest broadband
penetration rates in the region; DSL remains the dominant access
platform, accounting for about two-thirds of fixed broadband
connections; although fiber infrastructure in Cyprus is minimal
(supported by the government and regulator) to extend an FttP
service to about 200,000 premises; as a result, the number of DSL
subscribers is set to fall steadily in coming years as customers
are migrated to the fiber platform (2021)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line about 35 per 100 and about
140 per 100 for mobile-cellular teledensity; open-wire, fiber-optic
cable, and microwave radio relay (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 357 (area
administered by Turkish Cypriots uses the country code of Turkey -
90); a number of submarine cables, including the SEA-ME-WE-3,
CADMOS, MedNautilus Submarine System, POSEIDON, TE
North/TGN-Eurasia/SEACOM/Alexandros/Medes, UGARIT, Aphrodite2,
Hawk, Lev Submarine System, and Tamares combine to provide
connectivity to Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia,
Australia, and Southeast Asia; Turcyos-1 and Turcyos-2 submarine
cable in Turkish North Cyprus link to Turkey; tropospheric scatter;
satellite earth stations - 8 (3 Intelsat - 1 Atlantic Ocean and 2
Indian Ocean, 2 Eutelsat, 2 Intersputnik, and 1 Arabsat)
(2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
