   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">A former British colony, Cyprus became independent in 1960
following years of resistance to British rule. Tensions between the
Greek Cypriot majority and Turkish Cypriot minority communities
came to a head in December 1963, when violence broke out in the
capital of Nicosia. Despite the deployment of UN peacekeepers in
1964, sporadic intercommunal violence continued, forcing most
Turkish Cypriots into enclaves throughout the island. In 1974, a
Greek Government-sponsored attempt to overthrow the elected
president of Cyprus was met by military intervention from Turkey,
which soon controlled more than a third of the island. In 1983, the
Turkish Cypriot administered area declared itself the "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" ("TRNC"), but it is recognized only by
Turkey. An UN-mediated agreement, the Annan Plan, failed to win
approval by both communities in 2004. In February 2014, after a
hiatus of nearly two years, the leaders of the two communities
resumed formal discussions under UN auspices aimed at reuniting the
divided island. The most recent round of negotiations to reunify
the island were suspended in July 2017 after failure to
achieve a breakthrough. The entire island entered the EU on 1 May
2004, although the EU acquis - the body of common rights and
obligations - applies only to the areas under the internationally
recognized government, and is suspended in the "TRNC." However,
individual Turkish Cypriots able to document their eligibility for
Republic of Cyprus citizenship legally enjoy the same rights
accorded to other citizens of EU states.</subsection>

         <note title="Economy - overview">Even though the whole of the island is part of the EU, implementation of the EU "acquis communautaire" has been suspended in the area administered by Turkish Cypriots, known locally as the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" ("TRNC"), until political conditions permit the reunification of the island. The market-based economy of the "TRNC" is roughly one-fifth the size of its southern neighbor and is likewise dominated by the service sector with a large portion of the population employed by the government. In 2012 - the latest year for which data are available - the services sector, which includes the public sector, trade, tourism, and education, contributed 58.7% to economic output. In the same year, light manufacturing and agriculture contributed 2.7% and 6.2%, respectively. Manufacturing is limited mainly to food and beverages, furniture and fixtures, construction materials, metal and non-metal products, textiles and clothing. The "TRNC" maintains few economic ties with the Republic of Cyprus outside of trade in construction materials. Since its creation, the "TRNC" has heavily relied on financial assistance from Turkey, which supports the "TRNC" defense, telecommunications, water and postal services. The Turkish Lira is the preferred currency, though foreign currencies are widely accepted in business transactions. The "TRNC" remains vulnerable to the Turkish market and monetary policy because of its use of the Turkish Lira. The "TRNC" weathered the European financial crisis relatively unscathed - compared to the Republic of Cyprus - because of the lack of financial sector development, the health of the Turkish economy, and its separation from the rest of the island. The "TRNC" economy experienced growth estimated at 2.8% in 2013 and 2.3% in 2014 and is projected to grow 3.8% in 2015.;</note>
