   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Colombia was one of the three countries that emerged after the
dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others are Ecuador and
Venezuela). A decades-long conflict between government forces,
paramilitaries, and antigovernment insurgent groups heavily funded
by the drug trade, principally the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC), escalated during the 1990s. More than 31,000
former United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) paramilitaries
demobilized by the end of 2006, and the AUC as a formal
organization ceased to operate. In the wake of the paramilitary
demobilization, illegal armed groups arose, whose members include
some former paramilitaries. After four years of formal peace
negotiations, the Colombian Government signed a final peace accord
with the FARC in November 2016, which was subsequently ratified by
the Colombian Congress. The accord calls for members of the FARC to
demobilize, disarm, and reincorporate into society and politics.
The accord also committed the Colombian Government to create three
new institutions to form a 'comprehensive system for truth,
justice, reparation, and non-repetition,' to include a truth
commission, a special unit to coordinate the search for those who
disappeared during the conflict, and a 'Special Jurisdiction for
Peace' to administer justice for conflict-related crimes. Despite
decades of internal conflict and drug-related security challenges,
Colombia maintains relatively strong and independent democratic
institutions characterized by peaceful, transparent elections and
the protection of civil liberties.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Colombia is in the midst of a demographic transition resulting
from steady declines in its fertility, mortality, and population
growth rates. The birth rate has fallen from more than 6 children
per woman in the 1960s to just above replacement level today as a
result of increased literacy, family planning services, and
urbanization. However, income inequality is among the worst in the
world, and more than a third of the population lives below the
poverty line.Colombia experiences significant legal and illegal economic
emigration and refugee outflows. Large-scale labor emigration dates
to the 1960s; the United States and, until recently, Venezuela have
been the main host countries. Emigration to Spain picked up in the
1990s because of its economic growth, but this flow has since
diminished because of Spain’s ailing economy and high unemployment.
Colombia has been the largest source of Latin American refugees in
Latin America, nearly 400,000 of whom live primarily in Venezuela
and Ecuador. Venezuela’s political and economic crisis since 2015,
however, has created a reverse flow, consisting largely of
Colombians returning home.Forced displacement continues to be prevalent because of
violence among guerrillas, paramilitary groups, and Colombian
security forces. Afro-Colombian and indigenous populations are
disproportionately affected. Even with the Colombian Government’s
December 2016 peace agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia (FARC), the risk of displacement remains as other rebel
groups fill the void left by the FARC. Between 1985 and September
2017, nearly 7.6 million persons have been internally displaced,
the highest total in the world. These estimates may undercount
actual numbers because many internally displaced persons are not
registered. Historically, Colombia also has one of the world’s
highest levels of forced disappearances. About 30,000 cases have
been recorded over the last four decades—although the number is
likely to be much higher—including human rights activists, trade
unionists, Afro-Colombians, indigenous people, and farmers in rural
conflict zones.Because of political violence and economic problems, Colombia
received limited numbers of immigrants during the 19th and 20th
centuries, mostly from the Middle East, Europe, and Japan. More
recently, growth in the oil, mining, and manufacturing sectors has
attracted increased labor migration; the primary source countries
are Venezuela, the US, Mexico, and Argentina. Colombia has also
become a transit area for illegal migrants from Africa, Asia, and
the Caribbean -- especially Haiti and Cuba -- who are en route to
the US or Canada.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Military - note">as of 2022, the Colombian Armed Forces were primarily focused on
internal security, particularly counter-narcotics,
counter-terrorism, and counterinsurgency operations against drug
traffickers, militants from several factions of the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and National Liberation Army (ELN)
terrorist/guerrilla organizations, and other illegal armed groups;
the Colombian Government signed a peace agreement with the FARC in
2016, but some former members (known as dissidents) have returned
to fighting (note - these dissident groups include the designated
terrorist groups Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia - People's
Army or FARC-EP and Segunda Marquetalia; see Appendix T); the
Colombian military resumed operations against FARC dissidents and
their successor paramilitary groups in late 2019; in 2017, the
Colombian Government initiated formal peace talks with the ELN, but
in January 2019, the government suspended the peace talks shortly
after the ELN exploded a car bomb at the National Police Academy in
Bogotá and resumed counter-terrorism/counterinsurgency operations
against the group; operations against the FARC dissident groups and
the ELN continued into 2022, although the Colombian Government
resumed talks with ELN in November 2022; the military was also
focused on the security challenges posed by its neighbor,
Venezuela, where instability has attracted narcotics traffickers
and both the ELN and FARC dissidents, including FARC-EP and Segunda
Marquetalia, operate openly</subsection>
