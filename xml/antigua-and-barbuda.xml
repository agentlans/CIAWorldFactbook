   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Siboney were the first people to inhabit the islands of
Antigua and Barbuda in 2400 B.C., but Arawak Indians populated the
islands when Christopher COLUMBUS landed on his second voyage in
1493. Early Spanish and French settlements were succeeded by an
English colony in 1667. Slavery, to provide labor on the sugar
plantations on Antigua, was abolished in 1834. The islands became
an independent state within the British Commonwealth of Nations in
1981. On 6 September 2017, Hurricane Irma passed over the island of
Barbuda devastating the island and forcing the evacuation of the
population to Antigua. Almost all of the structures on Barbuda were
destroyed and the vegetation stripped, but Antigua was spared the
worst.</subsection>
