   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Siboney were the first people to inhabit the islands of
Antigua and Barbuda in 2400 B.C., but Arawak Indians populated the
islands when Christopher COLUMBUS landed on his second voyage in
1493. Early Spanish and French settlements were succeeded by an
English colony in 1667. Slavery, to provide labor on the sugar
plantations on Antigua, was abolished in 1834. The islands became
an independent state within the British Commonwealth of Nations in
1981. On 6 September 2017, Hurricane Irma passed over the island of
Barbuda devastating the island and forcing the evacuation of the
population to Antigua. Almost all of the structures on Barbuda were
destroyed and the vegetation stripped, but Antigua was spared the
worst.</subsection>

5G opportunities at the present time; network expansion and

Barbuda does not fully meet the minimum standards for the
elimination of trafficking but is making significant efforts to do
so; more trafficking cases were investigated, Family and Social
Services officials were trained for the first time, and funding
continued for the National Action Plan; however, the government did
not identify any victims for the second consecutive year, nor
initiate any prosecutions or convictions of traffickers; therefore
Antigua and Barbuda was downgraded to Tier 2 Watch List
(2022)<br/>
         <br/>
trafficking profile: traffickers exploit domestic
and foreign victims in Antigua and Barbuda, and exploit victims
from Antigua and Barbuda abroad; individuals from minority
communities are at higher risk; documented and undocumented
migrants from the Caribbean, notably Jamaica, Guyana, and the
Dominican Republic, were victims of sex trafficking and forced
labor; traffickers exploited victims in multiple-destination
trafficking, arriving in Antigua and Barbuda for a few months
before being exploited in other Caribbean countries such as St.
Kitts and Nevis and Barbados; sex trafficking, including girls,
occurs in bars, taverns, and brothels; forced labor, including
children, occurs in domestic service and retail stores,
particularly family-owned businesses; Cuban and PRC nationals
working in Antigua and Barbuda may have been forced to work there
by their own governments (2022)</subsection>
