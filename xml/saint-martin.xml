   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Although sighted by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1493 and claimed for
Spain, it was the Dutch who occupied the island in 1631 to exploit
its salt deposits. The Spanish retook the island in 1633 but
continued to be harassed by the Dutch. The Spanish finally
relinquished Saint Martin to the French and Dutch, who divided it
between themselves in 1648. Friction between the two sides caused
the border to frequently fluctuate over the next two centuries,
with the French eventually holding the greater portion of the
island (about 61%). The cultivation of sugarcane introduced African
slavery to the island in the late 18th century; the practice was
not abolished until 1848. The island became a free port in 1939;
the tourism industry was dramatically expanded during the 1970s and
1980s. In 2003, the populace of Saint Martin voted to secede from
Guadeloupe and in 2007, the northern portion of the island became a
French overseas collectivity. In 2010, the southern Dutch portion
of the island became the independent nation of Sint Maarten within
the Kingdom of the Netherlands. On 6 September 2017, Hurricane Irma
passed over the island of Saint Martin causing extensive damage to
roads, communications, electrical power, and housing; the UN
estimated that 90% of the buildings were damaged or destroyed.</subsection>
