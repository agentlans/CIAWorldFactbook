   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Indus Valley civilization, one of the oldest in the world
and dating back at least 5,000 years, spread over much of what is
presently Pakistan. During the second millennium B.C., remnants of
this culture fused with the migrating Indo-Aryan peoples. The area
underwent successive invasions in subsequent centuries from the
Persians, Greeks, Scythians, Arabs (who brought Islam), Afghans,
and Turks. The Mughal Empire flourished in the 16th and 17th
centuries; the British came to dominate the region in the 18th
century. The separation in 1947 of British India into the Muslim
state of Pakistan (with West and East sections) and largely Hindu
India was never satisfactorily resolved, and India and Pakistan
fought two wars and a limited conflict - in 1947-48, 1965, and 1999
respectively - over the disputed Kashmir territory. A third war
between these countries in 1971 - in which India assisted an
indigenous movement reacting to the marginalization of Bengalis in
Pakistani politics - resulted in East Pakistan becoming the
separate nation of Bangladesh.In response to Indian nuclear weapons testing, Pakistan
conducted its own tests in mid-1998. India-Pakistan relations
improved in the mid-2000s but have been rocky since the November
2008 Mumbai attacks and have been further strained by Indian
reports of cross-border militancy. Imran KHAN took office as prime
minister in 2018 after the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) party
won a plurality of seats in the July 2018 general elections.
Pakistan has been engaged in a decades-long armed conflict with
militant groups that target government institutions and civilians,
including the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other militant
networks.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">Pakistan’s telecom market transitioned from a regulated state-owned monopoly to a deregulated competitive structure in 2003, now aided by foreign investment; moderate growth over the last six years, supported by a young population and a rising use of mobile services; telecom infrastructure is improving, with investments in mobile-cellular networks, fixed-line subscriptions declining; system consists of microwave radio relay, coaxial cable, fiber-optic cable, cellular, and satellite networks; 4G mobile services broadly available; 5G tests ongoing; data centers in major cities; mobile and broadband doing well and dominate over fixed-broadband sector; future growth (in market size as well as revenue) is likely to come from the wider availability of value-added services on top of the expansion of 4G LTE and (from 2023) 5G mobile networks; the Universal Service Fund (USF) continues to direct investment towards the development of mobile broadband (and, to a lesser extent, fiber-based networks) in under-served and even under served areas of the country, with multiple projects being approved to start in 2021 and 2022 (2021)</note>
         <note title="domestic">mobile-cellular subscribership has increased; more than 90% of Pakistanis live within areas that have cell phone coverage; fiber-optic networks are being constructed throughout the country to increase broadband access and broadband penetration in Pakistan is increasing--by the end of 2021, 50% of the population had access to broadband services; fixed-line teledensity is a little over 1 per 100 and mobile-cellular roughly 84 per 100 persons (2021)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>

      <subsection title="Military - note">the military has carried out three coups since Pakistan's
independence in 1947 and as of 2022 remained a dominant force in
the country’s political arena; its chief external focus was on the
perceived threat from India, as well as implications of the fall of
the government in Kabul, but over the past 15 years, the military
also has increased its role in internal security missions,
including counterinsurgency and counterterrorism; it is the lead
security agency in many areas of the former Federally Administered
Tribal Areas

the military establishment also has a large stake in the country's
economic sector; through two large conglomerates, it is involved in
a diverse array of commercial activities, including banking,
construction of public projects, employment services, energy and
power generation, fertilizer, food, housing, real estate, and
security services

Pakistan and India have fought several conflicts since 1947,
including the Indo-Pakistan War of 1965 and the Indo-Pakistan and
Bangladesh War of Independence of 1971, as well as two clashes over
the disputed region of Kashmir (First Kashmir War of 1947 and the
Kargil Conflict of 1999); a fragile cease-fire in Kashmir was
reached in 2003, revised in 2018, and reaffirmed in 2021, although
the Line of Control remained contested as of 2022, and India has
accused Pakistan of backing armed separatists and terrorist
organizations in Jammu and Kashmir; in addition, India and Pakistan
have battled over the Siachen Glacier of Kashmir, which was seized
by India in 1984 with Pakistan attempting to retake the area in
1985, 1987, and 1995; despite a cease-fire, as of 2022 both sides
continued to maintain a permanent military presence there with
outposts at altitudes above 20,000 feet (over 6,000 meters) where
most casualties were due to extreme weather or the hazards of
operating in the high mountain terrain of the world’s highest
conflict, including avalanches, exposure, and altitude
sickness

Pakistan has Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA) status with the US; MNNA is
a designation under US law that provides foreign partners with
certain benefits in the areas of defense trade and security
cooperation; while MNNA status provides military and economic
privileges, it does not entail any security commitments (2022)</subsection>

      <subsection title="Disputes - international">Pakistan-Afghanistan: since 2002, with UN assistance,
Pakistan has repatriated about 5.3 million Afghan refugees, leaving
about 2.74-3 million; Pakistan has sent troops across and built
fences along some remote tribal areas of its treaty-defined Durand
Line border with Afghanistan, which serve as bases for foreign
terrorists and other illegal activities; in February 2022, amid
skirmishes between Taliban and Pakistani forces, Pakistan announced
its intent to finish constructing the barbed wire fence along the
Durand Line and bring nearby areas under its control; Afghan,
Coalition, and Pakistan military meet periodically to clarify the
alignment of the boundary on the ground and on mapsPakistan-China: none identifiedPakistan-India: Kashmir remains the site of the world's
largest and most militarized territorial dispute with portions
under the de facto administration of China (Aksai Chin), India
(Jammu and Kashmir), and Pakistan (Azad Kashmir and Northern
Areas); UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan has
maintained a small group of peacekeepers since 1949; India does not
recognize Pakistan's ceding historic Kashmir lands to China in
1964; India and Pakistan have initiated discussions on defusing the
armed standoff in the Siachen glacier region; the Siachen glacier
is claimed by both countries and militarily occupied by India:
Pakistan opposed India's fencing the highly militarized Line of
Control (completed in 2004) and the construction of the Baglihar
Dam on the Chenab River (opened in 2008) in Jammu and Kashmir,
which is part of the larger dispute on water sharing of the Indus
River and its tributaries; to defuse tensions and prepare for
discussions on a maritime boundary, India and Pakistan seek
technical resolution of the disputed boundary in Sir Creek estuary
at the mouth of the Rann of Kutch in the Arabian Sea; Pakistani
maps continue to show Junagadh in India's Gujarat State as part of
