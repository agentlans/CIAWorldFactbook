   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Burma, colonized by Britain in the 19th century and granted
independence post-World War II, contains ethnic Burman and scores
of other ethnic and religious minority groups that have all
resisted external efforts to consolidate control of the country
throughout its history, extending to the several minority groups
today that possess independent fighting forces and control pockets
of territory. Burman and armed ethnic minorities fought off-and-on
until military Gen. NE WIN seized power in 1962. He ruled Burma
until 1988 when a military junta took control. In 1990, the junta
permitted an election but then rejected the results when the main
opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) and its leader AUNG
SAN SUU KYI (ASSK) won in a landslide. The junta placed ASSK under
house arrest for much of the next 20 years, until November 2010. In
2007, rising fuel prices in Burma led pro-democracy activists and
Buddhist monks to launch a "Saffron Revolution" consisting of large
protests against the ruling junta, which violently suppressed the
movement by killing an unknown number of participants and arresting
thousands. The regime prevented new elections until it had drafted
a constitution designed to preserve its control; it passed the new
constitution in its 2008 referendum, days after Cyclone Nargis
killed at least 138,000. The junta conducted an election in 2010,
but the NLD boycotted the vote, and the military’s Union Solidarity
and Development Party easily won; international observers denounced
the election as flawed.<br/>
         <br/>
With former or current military officers installed in its most
senior positions, Burma began a halting process of political and
economic reforms. Officials freed prisoners, brokered ceasefires
with ethnic armed organizations (EAOs), amended courts, expanded
civil liberties, brought ASSK into government in 2012, and
permitted the NLD in 2015 to take power after a sweeping electoral
win.  However, Burma’s first credibly elected civilian
government, with ASSK as the de facto head of state, faced strong
headwinds after five decades of military dictatorship. The NLD
government drew international criticism for blocking investigations
of Burma’s military for operations, which the US Department of
State determined constituted genocide, on its Rohingya population
that killed thousands and forced more than 770,000 Rohingya to flee
into neighboring Bangladesh. The military did not support an NLD
pledge in 2019 to examine reforming the military’s 2008
constitution. When the 2020 elections resulted in further NLD
gains, the military denounced them as fraudulent. This challenge
led Commander-in-Chief Sr. General MIN AUNG HLAING (MAH) to launch
a coup in February 2021 that has left Burma reeling with the return
to authoritarian rule, the detention of ASSK and thousands of
pro-democracy actors, and renewed brutal repression against
protestors, widespread violence, and economic decline.Since the coup and subsequent crackdown, lawmakers elected in
the November 2020 election and members of parliament ousted by the
military have formed a shadow National Unity Government (NUG).
Members of the NUG include representatives from the NLD, ethnic
minority groups, civil society, and other minor parties. In May
2021, the NUG announced the formation of an an armed wing called
the People's Defense Force, and in September announced the start of
an insurgency against the military junta that has continued into
2022.</subsection>

up less than 3% of Burma's total population due to the large
outmigration of the Rohingya population since 2017</subsection>
      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Burma’s 2014 national census – the first in more than 30 years –
revealed that the country’s total population is approximately 51.5
million, significantly lower than the Burmese Government’s prior
estimate of 61 million.  The Burmese Government assumed that
the 2% population growth rate between 1973 and 1983 remained
constant and that emigration was zero, ignoring later sample
surveys showing declining fertility rates and substantial labor
migration abroad in recent decades.  These factors reduced the
estimated average annual growth rate between 2003 and 2014 to about
.9%.  Among Southeast Asian countries, Burma’s life expectancy
is among the lowest and its infant and maternal mortality rates are
among the highest.  The large difference in life expectancy
between women and men has resulted in older age cohorts consisting
of far more women than men.Burma’s demographic transition began in the 1950s, when
mortality rates began to drop.  Fertility did not start to
decrease until the 1960s, sustaining high population growth until
the decline accelerated in the 1980s.  The birth rate has held
fairly steady from 2000 until today.  Since the 1970s, the
total fertility rate (TFR) has fallen more than 60%, from almost 6
children per woman to 2.2 in 2016.  The reduced TFR is largely
a result of women marrying later and more women never marrying,
both being associated with greater educational attainment and labor
force participation among women.  TFR, however, varies
regionally, between urban and rural areas, by educational
attainment, and among ethnic groups, with fertility lowest in urban
areas (where it is below replacement level).The shift in Burma’s age structure has been slow (45% of the
population is still under 25 years of age) and uneven among its
socioeconomic groups.  Any economic boost from the growth of
the working-age population is likely to take longer to develop, to
have a smaller impact, and to be distributed unequally.  Rural
poverty and unemployment continue to drive high levels of internal
and international migration.  The majority of labor migration
is internal, mainly from rural to urban areas.  The new
government’s growing regional integration, reforms, and improved
diplomatic relations are increasing the pace of international
migration and destination choices.  As many as 4-5 million
Burmese, mostly from rural areas and several ethnic groups, have
taken up unskilled jobs abroad in agriculture, fishing,
manufacturing, and domestic service.  Thailand is the most
common destination, hosting about 70% of Burma’s international
migrants, followed by Malaysia, China, and Singapore. Burma is a patchwork of more than 130 religious and ethnic
groups, distinguishing it as one of the most diverse countries in
the region.  Ethnic minorities face substantial
discrimination, and the Rohingya, the largest Muslim group, are
arguably the most persecuted population in the country.  The
Burmese Government and the Buddhist majority see the Rohingya as a
threat to identity, competitors for jobs and resources, terrorists,
and some still resent them for their alliance with Burma’s British
colonizers during its 19th century.  Since at least
the 1960s, they have been subjected to systematic human rights
abuses, violence, marginalization, and disenfranchisement, which
authorities continue to deny.  Despite living in Burma for
centuries, many Burmese see the Rohingya as illegal Bengali
immigrants and refer to them Bengalis.  As a result, the
Rohingya have been classified as foreign residents and stripped of
their citizenship, rendering them one of the largest stateless
populations in the world.  Hundreds of thousands of Burmese from various ethnic groups have
been internally displaced (an estimated 644,000 as of year-end
2016) or have fled to neighboring countries over the decades
because of persecution, armed conflict, rural development projects,
drought, and natural disasters.  Bangladesh has absorbed the
most refugees from Burma, with an estimated 33,000 officially
recognized and 200,000 to 500,000 unrecognized Rohingya refugees,
as of 2016.  An escalation in violation has caused a surge in
the inflow of Rohingya refugees since late August 2017, raising the
number to an estimated 870,000.  As of June 2017, another
approximately 132,500 refugees, largely Rohingya and Chin, were
living in Malaysia, and more than 100,000, mostly Karen, were
housed in camps along the Burma-Thailand border. </subsection>

participate in elections, including: 1) barring parties and
candidates deemed to have links to individuals or organizations
alleged to have committed terrorism or other unlawful acts; 2)
stipulating that political parties that want to contest the
national election would also need to secure at least 100,000
members within 90 days of registration and have funds of 100
million Myanmar kyat ($45,500), 100 times more than previously
required, which would need to be deposited with a state-owned bank;
3) requiring that any existing party must apply for registration
within 60 days of the legislation being announced or be
invalidated; parties can also be suspended for 3 years, and
ultimately dissolved, for failing to comply with the provisions of
the new law; 4) not allowing parties to lodge an appeal against
election commission decisions on registration</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Burma, one of the least
developed telecom markets in Asia, saw growth in mobile and
broadband services through foreign competition and roll out of 4G
and 5G networks; infrastructure development challenged by flooding,
unreliable electricity, inefficient bureaucracy, and corruption;
digital divide affects rural areas; fixed broadband remains low due
to number of fixed-lines and near saturation of the mobile
platform; healthy m-banking platform; tests for NB-IoT; benefit
from launch of regional satellite; government utilizes intermittent
censorship and shut-down of Internet in political crisis
(2020)<br/>

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

Chinese and Russian/Soviet-era equipment with a smaller mix of more
modern acquisitions; in recent years, China and Russia have been
the leading suppliers of military hardware; Burma has a limited
defense industry, including a growing shipbuilding capability and
some production of ground force equipment that is largely based on
Chinese and Russian designs (2022)</subsection>

service obligation; male (ages 18-45) and female (ages 18-35)
professionals (including doctors, engineers, mechanics) serve up to
3 years; service terms may be stretched to 5 years in an officially
declared emergency (2021)</subsection>
      <subsection title="Military - note">since the country's founding, the armed forces have been heavily
involved in domestic politics, running the country for five decades
following a military coup in 1962; prior to the 2021 coup, the
military already controlled three key security ministries (Defense,
Border, and Home Affairs), one of two vice presidential
appointments, 25% of the parliamentary seats, and had a proxy
political party, the Union Solidarity and Development Party
(USDP)<br/>
         <br/>
the military owns and operates two business conglomerates that have
over 100 subsidiaries and close ties to other companies; the
business activities of these conglomerates include banking and
insurance, hotels, tourism, jade and ruby mining, timber,
construction, real estate, and the production of palm oil, sugar,
soap, cement, beverages, drinking water, coal, and gas; some of the
companies supply goods and services to the military, such as food,
clothing, insurance, and cellphone service; the military also
managed a film industry, publishing houses, and television
stations<br/>
         <br/>
the military's primary operational focus is internal security,
particularly attempts to quell a growing armed insurgency against
the 2021 coup and operations against ethnic-based separatist
groups; these operations have resulted in numerous civilian
casualties, human rights abuses, and internal
displacement--ethnic-based armed groups have been fighting for
self-rule against the Burmese Government since the country’s 1948
independence; as of 2022, there were approximately 20 such groups
operating in Burma with strengths of a few hundred up to more than
20,000 estimated fighters; some were organized along military lines
with "brigades" and "divisions" and armed with heavy weaponry,
including artillery; they reportedly controlled an estimated
one-third of the country’s territory, primarily in the border
regions; key groups included the United Wa State Army, Karen
National Union, Kachin Independence Army, Arakan Army, Ta’ang
National Liberation Army, and the Myanmar Nationalities Democratic
Alliance Army<br/>
         <br/>
Burma also has a large number of other armed militias which take
many different forms and varied in allegiances and size; most are
pro-military junta and associated with the Burmese military
(Tatmadaw); some are integrated within the Tatmadaw’s command
structure as Border Guard Forces (BGF); the BGF are organized as
325-man battalions, which include a mix of militia forces, ethnic
armed groups, and government soldiers; they are armed, supplied,
and paid by the Tatmadaw; other pro-military government militias
are not integrated within the Tatmadaw command structure but
receive direction from the military and are recognized as
government militias; the amount of Tatmadaw support they receive
varies depending on local security conditions; the third type of
pro-government militias are small community-based units that are
armed, coordinated, and trained by local Tatmadaw forces and
activated as needed; as of 2022, the military junta government was
raising new militia units to help combat the popular uprising<br/>
         <br/>
in mid-2022, the rebel National Unity Government claimed its armed
wing, the People's Defense Force (PDF), had more than 60,000
fighters organized into battalions; in addition, several armed
ethnic groups have added their support to anti-junta resistance
groups or joined forces with local units of the PDF (2022)</subsection>

   <section title="Transnational Issues">
      <subsection title="Disputes - international">over half of Burma's population consists of diverse ethnic
groups who have substantial numbers of kin in neighboring
countries; Bangladesh struggles to accommodate 912,000 Rohingya,
Burmese Muslim minority from Rakhine State, living as refugees in
Cox's Bazar; Burmese border authorities are constructing a 200 km
(124 mi) wire fence designed to deter illegal cross-border transit
and tensions from the military build-up along border with
Bangladesh in 2010; Bangladesh referred its maritime boundary
claims with Burma and India to the International Tribunal on the
Law of the Sea; Burmese forces attempting to dig in to the largely
autonomous Shan State to rout local militias tied to the drug
trade, prompts local residents to periodically flee into
neighboring Yunnan Province in China; fencing along the India-Burma
international border at Manipur's Moreh town is in progress to
check illegal drug trafficking and movement of militants; over
100,000 mostly Karen refugees and asylum seekers fleeing civil
strife, political upheaval, and economic stagnation in Burma were
living in remote camps in Thailand near the border as of May
2017</subsection>
      <subsection title="Refugees and internally displaced persons">IDPs: 671,011 (government offensives against
armed ethnic minority groups near its borders with China and
Thailand, natural disasters, forced land evictions) (2021)<br/>
         <br/>
stateless persons: 600,000 (2022); note - Rohingya
Muslims, living predominantly in Rakhine State, are Burma's main
group of stateless people; the Burmese Government does not
recognize the Rohingya as a "national race" and stripped them of
their citizenship under the 1982 Citizenship Law, categorizing them
as "non-nationals" or "foreign residents;" under the Rakhine State
Action Plan drafted in October 2014, the Rohingya must demonstrate
their family has lived in Burma for at least 60 years to qualify
for a lesser naturalized citizenship and the classification of
Bengali or be put in detention camps and face deportation;
native-born but non-indigenous people, such as Indians, are also
stateless; the Burmese Government does not grant citizenship to
children born outside of the country to Burmese parents who left
the country illegally or fled persecution, such as those born in
Thailand; the number of stateless persons has decreased
dramatically because hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have fled to
Bangladesh since 25 August 2017 to escape violence</subsection>
      <subsection title="Trafficking in persons">tier rating: Tier 3 — Burma does not fully meet
the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not
making significant efforts to do so, therefore Burma remained on
Tier 3; the military continued the use of children and adults for
forced labor; the regime did not prosecute any military or deposed
government officials for the forced labor, and it prevented civil
society organizations from assisting trafficking victims;
displacement resulting from military conflict, exacerbated by the
February 2021 military coup that deposed the democratically elected
government, made Rohingya and other ethnic groups more vulnerable
to human trafficking (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
trafficking profile: human traffickers exploit
men, women, and children through forced labor, and women and
children in sex trafficking in Burma and abroad; Burmese men are
forced to work domestically and abroad in fishing, manufacturing,
forestry, agriculture, and construction; fishermen are lured into
forced labor in remote waters and offshore by recruitment agencies
in Burma and Southeast Asia; Burmese women increasingly are lured
to China for marriage under false pretenses and are subjected to
sex trafficking, forced concubinism and childbearing, and forced
domestic labor; men, women, and children in ethnic minority areas
are at increased risk of sex trafficking and forced labor in
farming, manufacturing, and construction; men and boys are
recruited locally by traffickers for forced labor in oil palm and
rubber plantations, in mining, fishing, and bamboo, teak, and rice
harvesting; some military personnel, civilian brokers, border guard
officials, and ethnic armed groups continue to recruit child
soldiers, particularly in conflict areas; discriminatory laws and
hiring practices put LGBTQI+ individuals at higher risk for
trafficking (2022)</subsection>
      <subsection title="Illicit drugs">a major source of illicit methamphetamine and opiates; illicit
import of precursor chemicals from China increased production and
trafficking of synthetic drugs; second-largest opium poppy
cultivator in Asia, with an estimated 20,200 hectares grown in
2019; “Yaba,” a tablet containing methamphetamine, caffeine, and
other stimulants, is produced in Burma and trafficked regionally;
ethnic armed organizations, military-affiliated militias, and
transnational criminal organizations oversee billion dollar drug
production and trafficking industry; drugs produced in Burma are
trafficked beyond Southeast Asia to Australia, New Zealand, and
Japan; not a major source or transit country for drugs entering the
United States </subsection>
