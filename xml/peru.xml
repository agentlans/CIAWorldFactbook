   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Ancient Peru was the seat of several prominent Andean
civilizations, most notably that of the Incas whose empire was
captured by Spanish conquistadors in 1533. Peru declared its
independence in 1821, and remaining Spanish forces were defeated in
1824. After a dozen years of military rule, Peru returned to
democratic leadership in 1980 but experienced economic problems and
the growth of a violent insurgency. President Alberto FUJIMORI's
election in 1990 ushered in a decade that saw a dramatic turnaround
in the economy and significant progress in curtailing guerrilla
activity. Nevertheless, the president's increasing reliance on
authoritarian measures and an economic slump in the late 1990s
generated mounting dissatisfaction with his regime, which led to
his resignation in 2000. A caretaker government oversaw a new
election in the spring of 2001, which installed Alejandro TOLEDO
Manrique as the new head of government - Peru's first
democratically elected president of indigenous ethnicity. The
presidential election of 2006 saw the return of Alan GARCIA Perez
who, after a disappointing presidential term from 1985 to 1990,
oversaw a robust economic rebound. Former army officer Ollanta
HUMALA Tasso was elected president in June 2011, and carried on the
sound, market-oriented economic policies of the three preceding
administrations. Poverty and unemployment levels have fallen
dramatically in the last decade, and today Peru boasts one of the
best performing economies in Latin America. Pedro Pablo KUCZYNSKI
Godard won a very narrow presidential runoff election in June 2016.
Facing impeachment after evidence surfaced of his involvement in a
vote-buying scandal, President KUCZYNSKI offered his resignation on
21 March 2018. Two days later, First Vice President Martin Alberto
VIZCARRA Cornejo was sworn in as president. On 30 September 2019,
President VIZCARRA invoked his constitutional authority to dissolve
Peru's Congress after months of battling with the body over
anticorruption reforms. New congressional elections took place on
26 January 2020 resulting in the return of an opposition-led
legislature. President VIZCARRA was impeached by Congress on 9
November 2020 for a second time and removed from office after being
accused of corruption and mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Because of vacancies in the vice-presidential positions,
constitutional succession led to the President of the Peruvian
Congress, Manuel MERINO, becoming the next president of Peru. His
ascension to office was not well received by the population, and
large protests forced his resignation on 15 November 2020. On 17
November, Francisco SAGASTI assumed the position of President of
Peru after being appointed President of the Congress the previous
day. Jose Pedro CASTILLO Terrones won the second round of
presidential elections on 6 June 2021 and was inaugurated on 28
July.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Peru's urban and coastal communities have benefited much more
from recent economic growth than rural, Afro-Peruvian, indigenous,
and poor populations of the Amazon and mountain regions. The
poverty rate has dropped substantially during the last decade but
remains stubbornly high at about 30% (more than 55% in rural
areas). After remaining almost static for about a decade, Peru's
malnutrition rate began falling in 2005, when the government
introduced a coordinated strategy focusing on hygiene, sanitation,
and clean water. School enrollment has improved, but achievement
scores reflect ongoing problems with educational quality. Many poor
children temporarily or permanently drop out of school to help
support their families. About a quarter to a third of Peruvian
children aged 6 to 14 work, often putting in long hours at
hazardous mining or construction sites.Peru was a country of immigration in the 19th and early 20th
centuries, but has become a country of emigration in the last few
decades. Beginning in the 19th century, Peru brought in Asian
contract laborers mainly to work on coastal plantations.
Populations of Chinese and Japanese descent - among the largest in
Latin America - are economically and culturally influential in Peru
today. Peruvian emigration began rising in the 1980s due to an
economic crisis and a violent internal conflict, but outflows have
stabilized in the last few years as economic conditions have
improved. Nonetheless, more than 2 million Peruvians have emigrated
in the last decade, principally to the US, Spain, and
Argentina.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">after suffering a sharp retraction in the number of subscriptions and revenue during 2020 due to the pandemic, Peru’s telecom sector managed to stage a small recovery in the first half of 2021; it will likely be two to three years before penetration rates return to the peak levels last seen in 2018; this is especially true given the overwhelming influence of mobile on Peru’s telecommunications market, which now commands almost 95% of all connections; Peru’s fixed-line teledensity continued its slow dropping below 7% at the end of 2021; investment in network infrastructure is mainly focused on rolling out fiber cable for fixed broadband services in (mainly) urban areas; fixed broadband services inched higher to reach 8.4% at the end of 2020, a positive result that reflected the shift to working from home during enforced lock downs at the start of the year; yet Peru has a relatively low level of computer use, and prices for fixed broadband services are among the highest in Latin America; the overwhelmingly preferred internet access platform will remain the smartphone, with a further 8.6% growth in the number of mobile broadband subscriptions expected in 2021 (2021)</note>
         <note title="domestic">fixed-line teledensity is nearly 7 per 100 persons; mobile-cellular teledensity, spurred by competition among multiple providers, now nearly 133 telephones per 100 persons; nationwide microwave radio relay system and a domestic satellite system with 12 earth stations (2020)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>
