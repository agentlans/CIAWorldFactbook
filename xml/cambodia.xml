      <subsection title="Background">Most Cambodians consider themselves to be Khmers, descendants of
the Angkor Empire that extended over much of Southeast Asia and
reached its zenith between the 10th and 13th centuries. Attacks by
the Thai and Cham (from present-day Vietnam) weakened the empire,
ushering in a long period of decline. The king placed the country
under French protection in 1863, and it became part of French
Indochina in 1887. Following the Japanese occupation in World War
II, Cambodia gained full independence from France in 1953. In April
1975, after a seven-year struggle, communist Khmer Rouge forces
captured Phnom Penh and evacuated all cities and towns. At least
1.5 million Cambodians died from execution, forced hardships, or
starvation during the Khmer Rouge regime under POL POT. A December
1978 Vietnamese invasion drove the Khmer Rouge into the
countryside, began a 10-year Vietnamese occupation, and touched off
20 years of civil war.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Cambodia is a predominantly rural country with among the most
ethnically and religiously homogenous populations in Southeast
Asia: more than 95% of its inhabitants are Khmer and more than 95%
are Buddhist.  The population’s size and age structure shrank
and then rebounded during the 20th century as a result
of conflict and mass death.  During the Khmer Rouge regime
between 1975 and 1979 as many as 1.5 to 2 million people are
estimated to have been killed or died as a result of starvation,
disease, or overwork – a loss of about 25% of the population. 
At the same time, emigration was high, and the fertility rate
sharply declined.  In the 1980s, after the overthrow of the
Khmer Rouge, fertility nearly doubled and reached pre-Khmer Rouge
levels of close to 7 children per woman, reflecting in part higher
infant survival rates.  The baby boom was followed by a
sustained fertility decline starting in the early 1990s, eventually
decreasing from 3.8 in 2000 to 2.9 in 2010, although the rate
varied by income, education, and rural versus urban location. 
Despite continuing fertility reduction, Cambodia still has a
youthful population that is likely to maintain population growth
through population momentum. Improvements have also been made in
mortality, life expectancy, and contraceptive prevalence, although
reducing malnutrition among children remains stalled. 
Differences in health indicators are pronounced between urban and
rural areas, which experience greater poverty.Cambodia is predominantly a country of migration, driven by the
search for work, education, or marriage.  Internal migration
is more prevalent than international migration, with rural to urban
migration being the most common, followed by rural to rural
migration.  Urban migration focuses on the pursuit of
unskilled or semi-skilled jobs in Phnom Penh, with men working
mainly in the construction industry and women working in garment
factories.  Most Cambodians who migrate abroad do so illegally
using brokers because it is cheaper and faster than through formal
channels, but doing so puts them at risk of being trafficked for
forced labor or sexual exploitation.  Young Cambodian men and
women migrate short distances across the Thai border using
temporary passes to work in agriculture, while others migrate long
distances primarily into Thailand and Malaysia for work in
agriculture, fishing, construction, manufacturing, and domestic
service.  Cambodia was a refugee sending country in the 1970s
and 1980s as a result of the brutality of the Khmer Rouge regime,
its ousting by the Vietnamese invasion, and the resultant civil
war.  Tens of thousands of Cambodians fled to Thailand; more
than 100,000 were resettled in the US in the 1980s.  Cambodia
signed a multi-million dollar agreement with Australia in 2014 to
voluntarily resettle refugees seeking shelter in Australia. 
However, the deal has proven to be a failure because of poor
conditions and a lack of support services for the few refugees
willing to accept the offer.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">Cambodia’s mobile-dominated telecoms sector spent much of 2020 battling two major challenges: the global pandemic, and the government’s retraction of trial licenses for the rollout of 5G; citing concerns about waste and inefficiency occurring if each operator built a separate 5G infrastructure in order to maximize their own network’s coverage (and, presumably, to capture greater market share), the regulator withdrew the licenses that the operators had been using for their 5G trials; this was despite all of the operators having already announced a successful completion of their trials; more than a year later, the market is still waiting on the government to release its 5G policy and roadmap, along with the allocation of spectrum and approvals to permit commercial operation; there is little expectation of any further progress happening before the start of 2022; the mobile network operators have maintained their focus and investment strategies on upgrading and expanding their existing LTE networks around the country, and to 5G-enable their base stations; when the 5G market eventually arrives, the underlying infrastructure will at least be ready to support a rapid adoption of the higher-value applications and services; the mobile market fell back slightly during 2020 and 2021 (in terms of total subscriber numbers) as the Covid-19 crisis wore on, but it remains in relatively good health as mobile users increased their data usage over the period; the mobile broadband market experienced a small but very rare contraction in 2020, although rates were already very high in this area; there is likely to be a quick rebound to previous levels once economic conditions stabilize, followed by a modest rates of growth over the next five years; the number of fixed telephony lines in service continues to fall sharply as customers migrate to mobile platforms for both voice and data; the lack of any widespread fixed-line infrastructure has had a flow-on effect in the fixed-line broadband market, a sector that also remains largely under-developed (2021)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>

<note title="note">in December 2021, the US Government halted arms-related trade with Cambodia, citing deepening Chinese military influence, corruption, and human rights abuses by the government and armed forces; the policy of denial applied to licenses or other approvals for exports and imports of defense articles and defense services destined for or originating in Cambodia, with exceptions (on a case-by-case basis) related to conventional weapons destruction and humanitarian demining activities</note>

      <subsection title="Military - note">the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF) was re-established in
1993 under the first coalition government from the merger of the
Cambodian Government’s military forces (Cambodian People’s Armed
Forces) and the two non-communist resistance forces (Sihanoukist
National Army, aka National Army for Khmer Independence, and the
Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces); thousands of
communist Khmer Rouge fighters began surrendering by 1994 under a
government amnesty program and the last of the Khmer Rouge forces
(National Army of Democratic Kampuchea) were demobilized or
absorbed into the RCAF in 1999

Cambodia was once one of the most land mined countries in the
world; by the early 1990s, various aid organizations estimated
there were 8 to 10 million landmines scattered throughout the
country; the mines were laid during Cambodia’s decades-long war by
the Cambodian army, the Vietnamese, the Khmer Rouge, the
non-communist fighters, and US forces; part of Cambodia's defense
policy is demining the territory with the intent of having the
entire country cleared of unexploded ordnances by 2035; over 1
million landmines and over 3 million explosives were discovered and
removed from 1992 to 2018 (2022)</subsection>

      <subsection title="Disputes - international">Cambodia-Laos: Cambodia is concerned that Laos'
extensive upstream dam construction will affect Cambodian
waters downstreamCambodia-Thailand: Cambodia and Thailand have agreed to
maintain peace along the border regardless of the decision of the
International Court of Justice (ICJ) over territorial dispute near
Cambodia's Preah Vihear Temple; the ICJ decision of 11 November
2013 determined that Cambodia had sovereignty over the whole
territory of the promontory of Preah Vihear; the
border disputes do not involve large amounts of territory, and
most of the issues were settled by the Nov. 11, 2013 ICJ rulingCambodia-Vietnam: issues include casinos built in
Cambodia near the border (gambling and prostitution); narcotics
(criminals, crime, and abuse); trafficking of women and children,
petrol smuggling into Cambodia from Vietnam, illegal logging, and
illegal migration; a positive development is the special economic
Zone in Bavet, Svay Rieng Province, Cambodia that is being
developed by the Manhattan (Svay Rieng) International Group of
Taiwan</subsection>

      <subsection title="Trafficking in persons">
         <note title="tier rating">Tier 3 — Cambodia does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so; therefore, Cambodia was downgraded to Tier 3; authorities took some steps to address trafficking, including continuing to arrest, prosecute and convict some traffickers, and identifying and assisting some victims; however, corruption continued to impede law enforcement efforts, legal actions, and provision of services to victims; authorities did not investigate or take legal action against any officials involved in the large majority of credible reports of complicity; officials failed to proactively identify victims among the highly vulnerable groups of men, women, and children subjected to human trafficking throughout the country; authorities did not provide adequate protection for victims domestically or overseas and relied heavily on foreign donors and NGOs to provide care (2022)</note>
         <note title="trafficking profile">human traffickers exploit Cambodian men, women, and children in forced labor and sex trafficking in Cambodia and abroad, and foreign nationals are trafficked in Cambodia; Cambodian adults and children migrate to other countries in the region or increasingly to the Middle East where traffickers force them to work in agriculture, fishing, construction, manufacturing, and domestic servitude; significant numbers of Cambodian men and boys are subject to forced labor on Thai ships in international waters and may experience physical abuse, nonpayment or underpayment of wages, and confinement at sea; brick kiln owners exploit thousands of Cambodians, including children, through debt-based coercion; children from poor families are vulnerable to forced labor, often with the complicity of their parents, in domestic servitude, forced begging, or street vending in Thailand and Vietnam; traffickers recruit Cambodian women and girls from rural areas under false pretenses, or sometimes through complicit parents, to travel to the PRC to marry PRC-national men where they are subject to sex trafficking or forced labor; Cambodian and ethnic Vietnamese women and girls from rural areas move to cities and tourist areas where they are sex trafficked (2022)</note>
