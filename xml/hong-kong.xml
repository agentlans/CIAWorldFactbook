   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Seized by the UK in 1841, Hong Kong was formally ceded by China
the following year at the end of the First Opium War; the Kowloon
Peninsula was added in 1860 at the end of the Second Opium War, and
was further extended when Britain obtained a 99-year lease of the
New Territories in 1898. Pursuant to an agreement signed by China
and the UK on 19 December 1984, Hong Kong became the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the People's Republic of
China on 1 July 1997. In this agreement, China promised that, under
its "one country, two systems" formula, China's socialist economic
and strict political system would not be imposed on Hong Kong and
that Hong Kong would enjoy a "high degree of autonomy" in all
matters except foreign and defense affairs for the subsequent 50
years.<br/>
         <br/>
Since the turnover, Hong Kong has continued to enjoy success as an
international financial center. However, dissatisfaction with the
Hong Kong Government and growing Chinese political influence has
been a central issue and led to considerable civil unrest,
including large-scale pro-democracy demonstrations in 2019 after
the HKSAR attempted to revise a local ordinance to allow
extraditions to mainland China. In response, the governments of the
HKSAR and China took several actions that reduced the city's
autonomy and placed new restrictions on the rights of Hong Kong
residents, moves that were widely criticized to be in direct
contravention of obligations under the Hong Kong Basic Law and the
Sino-British Joint Declaration. Chief among these actions was a
sweeping national security law for Hong Kong imposed by the Chinese
Government in June 2020 that criminalized acts such as those
interpreted as secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with
foreign or external forces. The law ushered in a widespread
crackdown on public protests, criticism of authorities, and freedom
of speech, and was used by authorities to target pro-democracy
activists, organizations, and media companies. Democratic lawmakers
and political figures were arrested, while others fled abroad. At
the same time, dozens of civil society groups and several
independent media outlets were closed or have disbanded. In March
2021, Beijing imposed a more restrictive electoral system,
including restructuring the Legislative Council (LegCo) and
allowing only government-approved candidates to run for office,
claiming it was to ensure a system of "patriots" governed Hong
Kong. The changes ensured that virtually all seats in the December
2021 LegCo election were won by pro-establishment candidates and
effectively ended political opposition to Beijing in the
territory.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Hong Kong’s
telecommunications sector continues to stay near the top of world
rankings for the industry; it has kept its #1 spot in the Asian
region in terms of the maturity of its telecom market – a
reflection of the high penetration rates across mobile, mobile
broadband, and fixed broadband; even fixed-line teledensity in Hong
Kong is impressive at over 50%, although it too has started a
gradual decline in keeping with most other telecom markets around
the world, as consumers slowly transition over to the mobile
platform for all of their communication needs (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: microwave radio relay links and
extensive fiber-optic network; fixed-line is over 52 per 100 and
mobile-cellular is nearly 292 subscriptions per 100 (2020)<br/>

international: country code - 852; landing points

SeaMeWe-3, SJC and TGN-IA submarine cables that provide connections
to Asia, US, Australia, the Middle East, and Europe; satellite
earth stations - 3 Intelsat (1 Pacific Ocean and 2 Indian Ocean);
coaxial cable to Guangzhou, China (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

Kong does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination

immigration, customs, labor, and justice departments dedicated to
trafficking issues; authorities screened more than 7,000 vulnerable
individuals for trafficking; the labor department introduced a
victim identification mechanism to its division offices; the
government provided anti-trafficking training to various officials;
the government did not investigate, prosecute, or convict any cases
of labor trafficking, investigated fewer sex trafficking cases, and
did not provide victims any government-funded services; the
government continued to penalize victims for unlawful acts
traffickers compelled them to commit; no legislation was enacted to
fully criminalize all forms of trafficking (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
trafficking profile: human traffickers exploit
domestic and foreign victims in Hong Kong, and traffickers also
exploit victims from Hong Kong abroad; traffickers exploit women
from Eastern Europe, Africa, and Southeast Asia in sex trafficking;
some women in Hong Kong – often with the assistance of their
families – deceive Indian and Pakistani men into arranged marriages
involving forced domestic service, bonded labor in construction and
other physically demanding industries, and other forms of abuse via
exploitative contracts; drug trafficking syndicates coerced South
