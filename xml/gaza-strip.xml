   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Gaza Strip has been under the de facto governing authority
of the Islamic Resistance Movement (HAMAS) since 2007, and has
faced years of conflict, poverty, and humanitarian crises.
Inhabited since at least the 15th century B.C., the Gaza Strip area
has been dominated by many different peoples and empires throughout
its history; it was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in the
early 16th century. The Gaza Strip fell to British forces during
World War I, becoming a part of the British Mandate of Palestine.
Following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Egypt administered the newly
formed Gaza Strip; Israel captured it in the Six-Day War in 1967.
Under a series of agreements known as the Oslo accords signed
between 1993 and 1999, Israel transferred to the newly-created
Palestinian Authority (PA) security and civilian responsibility for
many Palestinian-populated areas of the Gaza Strip as well as the
West Bank.In 2000, a violent intifada or uprising began, and in 2001
negotiations to determine the permanent status of the West bank and
Gaza Strip stalled. Subsequent attempts to re-start negotiations
have not resulted in progress toward determining final status of
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel in late 2005 unilaterally
withdrew all of its settlers and soldiers and dismantled its
military facilities in the Gaza Strip, but it continues to control
the Gaza Strip’s land and maritime borders and airspace. In early
2006, HAMAS won a majority in the Palestinian Legislative Council
election. Fatah, the dominant Palestinian political faction in the
West Bank, and HAMAS failed to maintain a unity government, leading
to violent clashes between their respective supporters and HAMAS’s
violent seizure of all PA military and governmental institutions in
the Gaza Strip in June 2007. Since HAMAS’s takeover, Israel and
Egypt have enforced tight restrictions on movement and access of
goods and individuals into and out of the territory. Fatah and
HAMAS have since reached a series of agreements aimed at restoring
political unity between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank but have
struggled to enact them.Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip and the Israel Defense
Forces periodically exchange projectiles and air strikes,
respectively, threatening broader conflict. In May 2021, HAMAS
launched rockets at Israel, sparking an 11-day conflict that also
involved other Gaza-based militant groups. Egypt, Qatar, and the UN
Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process have
negotiated ceasefires to avert a broader conflict. Since 2018,
HAMAS has also coordinated demonstrations along the Gaza-Israel
security fence. Many of these protests have turned violent,
resulting in several Israeli soldiers’ deaths and injuries as well
as more than 200 Palestinian deaths and thousands of injuries, most
of which occurred during weekly March of Return protests from 2018
to the end of 2019. </subsection>

and telecom infrastructure, limits mobile internet speeds in the
Palestinian territories to levels that are significantly lower than
in Israel and Jewish West Bank settlements; the World Bank urged
Israel to let Palestinian cellular companies set up more advanced
networks, and to ease restrictions on the import of equipment
needed to build and operate them; Israel is rolling out fifth
generation technology for its citizens, while the West Bank
operates on 3G and Gaza, 2G; Israeli mobile operators don’t
officially service Palestinian areas, but many Palestinians use the
faster Israeli networks with SIM cards; the Times of Israel
reported in November that Israel tentatively agreed to let
Palestinian operators launch 4G services<br/>

but maintains security forces in addition to its military wing, the
'Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades; the military wing reports to the

      <subsection title="Military - note">since seizing control of the Gaza Strip in 2007, HAMAS has
claimed responsibility for numerous rocket attacks into Israel and
organized protests at the border between Gaza and Israel, resulting
in violent clashes, casualties, and reprisal military actions by
the Israel Defense Forces (IDF); HAMAS and Israel fought an 11-day
conflict in May of 2021, which ended in an informal truce; sporadic
clashes continued into 2022, including incendiary balloon attacks
from Gaza and retaliatory IDF strikes; Palestine Islamic Jihad
(PIJ) has conducted numerous attacks on Israel since the 1980s,
including a barrage of mortar and rocket strikes in 2020, also
prompting IDF counter-strikes; see <br/>Appendix
T for more details on HAMAS and PIJ<br/>
         <br/>
in 2017, HAMAS and PIJ announced the formation of a "joint
operations room" to coordinate the activities of their armed wings;
by late 2020, the formation consisted of 12 militant groups
operating in Gaza and had conducted its first joint training
exercise (2022)</subsection>
