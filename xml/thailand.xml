   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Two unified Thai kingdoms emerged in the mid-13th century. The
Sukhothai, located in the south-central plains, gained its
independence from the Khmer Empire to the east. By the late 13th
century, Sukhothai’s territory extended into present-day Burma and
Laos. Sukhotai lasted until the mid-15th century. The Thai Lan Na
Kingdom was established in the north with its capital at Chang Mai.
Lan Na was conquered by the Burmese in the
16th century. The Ayutthaya Kingdom (14th-18th
centuries) succeeded the Sukhothai and would become known as the
Siamese Kingdom. During the Ayutthaya period, the Thai/Siamese
peoples consolidated their hold on what is present-day central and
north-central Thailand. Following a military defeat at the hands of
the Burmese in 1767, the Siamese Kingdom rose to new heights under
the military ruler TAKSIN, who defeated the Burmese occupiers and
expanded the kingdom’s territory into modern-day northern Thailand
(formerly the Lan Na Kingdom), Cambodia, Laos, and the Malay
Peninsula. The kingdom fought off additional Burmese invasions and
raids in the late 1700s and early 1800s. In the mid-1800s, Western
pressure led to Siam signing trade treaties that reduced the
country’s sovereignty and independence. In the 1890s and 1900s, the
British and French forced the kingdom to cede Cambodian, Laotian,
and Malay territories that had been under Siamese control.A bloodless revolution in 1932 led to the establishment of a
constitutional monarchy. After the Japanese invaded Thailand in
1941, the government split into a pro-Japan faction and a pro-Ally
faction backed by the king. Following the war, Thailand became a US
treaty ally in 1954 after sending troops to Korea and later
fighting alongside the US in Vietnam. Thailand since 2005 has
experienced several rounds of political turmoil including a
military coup in 2006 that ousted then Prime Minister THAKSIN
Chinnawat, followed by large-scale street protests by competing
political factions in 2008, 2009, and 2010. THAKSIN's youngest
sister, YINGLAK Chinnawat, in 2011 led the Puea Thai Party to an
electoral win and assumed control of the government.In early May 2014, after months of large-scale anti-government
protests in Bangkok beginning in November 2013, YINGLAK was removed
from office by the Constitutional Court and in late May 2014 the
Royal Thai Army, led by Royal Thai Army Gen. PRAYUT Chan-ocha,
staged a coup against the caretaker government. The
military-affiliated National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO),
led by PRAYUT as the appointed minister, ruled the country for more
than four years, during which time the NCPO drafted a new
constitution guaranteeing military sway over Thai politics in
future elections by allowing the military to appoint the entire
250-member Senate and requiring a joint meeting of the House and
Senate to select the prime minister, effectively giving the
military a veto over the top executive. King PHUMIPHON Adunyadet
passed away in October 2016 after 70 years on the throne; his only
son, WACHIRALONGKON Bodinthrathepphayawarangkun (aka King RAMA X),
ascended the throne in December 2016. He signed the new
constitution in April 2017. A long-delayed election in March 2019,
disputed and widely viewed as skewed in favor of the party aligned
with the military, allowed PRAYUT to continue his premiership. The
country experienced large-scale pro-democracy protests in 2020.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Thailand has experienced a substantial fertility decline since
the 1960s largely due to the nationwide success of its voluntary
family planning program.  In just one generation, the total
fertility rate (TFR) shrank from 6.5 children per woman in 1960s to
below the replacement level of 2.1 in the late 1980s.  Reduced
fertility occurred among all segments of the Thai population,
despite disparities between urban and rural areas in terms of
income, education, and access to public services.  The
country’s “reproductive revolution” gained momentum in the 1970s as
a result of the government’s launch of an official population
policy to reduce population growth, the introduction of new forms
of birth control, and the assistance of foreign non-government
organizations.  Contraceptive use rapidly increased as new
ways were developed to deliver family planning services to
Thailand’s then overwhelmingly rural population.  The
contraceptive prevalence rate increased from just 14% in 1970 to
58% in 1981 and has remained about 80% since 2000. Thailand’s receptiveness to family planning reflects the
predominant faith, Theravada Buddhism, which emphasizes
individualism, personal responsibility, and independent
decision-making.  Thai women have more independence and a
higher status than women in many other developing countries and are
not usually pressured by their husbands or other family members
about family planning decisions.  Thailand’s relatively
egalitarian society also does not have the son preference found in
a number of other Asian countries; most Thai ideally want one child
of each sex.Because of its low fertility rate, increasing life expectancy,
and growing elderly population, Thailand has become an aging
society that will face growing labor shortages.  The
proportion of the population under 15 years of age has shrunk
dramatically, the proportion of working-age individuals has peaked
and is starting to decrease, and the proportion of elderly is
growing rapidly.  In the short-term, Thailand will have to
improve educational quality to increase the productivity of its
workforce and to compete globally in skills-based industries. 
An increasing reliance on migrant workers will be necessary to
mitigate labor shortfalls.Thailand is a destination, transit, and source country for
migrants. It has 3-4 million migrant workers as of 2017, mainly
providing low-skilled labor in the construction, agriculture,
manufacturing, services, and fishing and seafood processing
sectors.  Migrant workers from other Southeast Asian countries
with lower wages – primarily Burma and, to a lesser extent, Laos
and Cambodia – have been coming to Thailand for decades to work in
labor-intensive industries.  Many are undocumented and are
vulnerable to human trafficking for forced labor, especially in the
fisheries industry, or sexual exploitation.  A July 2017
migrant worker law stiffening fines on undocumented workers and
their employers, prompted tens of thousands of migrants to go
home.  Fearing a labor shortage, the Thai Government has
postponed implementation of the law until January 2018 and is
rapidly registering workers.  Thailand has also hosted ethnic
minority refugees from Burma for more than 30 years; as of 2016,
approximately 105,000 mainly Karen refugees from Burma were living
in nine camps along the Thailand-Burma border.Thailand has a significant amount of internal migration, most
often from rural areas to urban centers, where there are more job
opportunities.  Low- and semi-skilled Thais also go abroad to
work, mainly in Asia and a smaller number in the Middle East and
Africa, primarily to more economically developed countries where
they can earn higher wages.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">Thailand’s telecom sector is relatively mature and hosts a mix of public and private sector players; the mobile market is highly developed and has experienced strong growth over the last seven years; the market returned to growth in 2021 after it contracted in 2020 driven by the Covid-19 pandemic, and a steep decline in inbound tourism; it remains highly saturated, owing to overall maturity and the popularity of multiple SIM card use, which has resulted in a particularly high penetration rate; in general, the sector retains considerable potential given the impetus of 5G, the recent spectrum auctions, and continued network deployments by the country’s network operators; further auctions of spectrum in the 700MHz band (being repurposed from digital TV broadcasting), and in the 3.6GHz range will further improve network capacity; in the wire line segment, the decline in fixed-line penetration is expected to continue as subscribers migrate to mobile networks for voice and data services; the emphasis among operators has been to bolster their fiber footprints in key high-value areas; the transition to fiber from DSL and cable has also been facilitated by changes to the regulatory structure that have removed some barriers to investment; this is supporting the cannibalization of older copper-based DSL lines by fiber; the returns from this investment remain a long-term prospect as consumers still favor entry-level packages; there is also strong interest from the government, as well as private vendors, in establishing Thailand as a data center hub to serve the region; the size, capacity and spread of existing data centers in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) outside of Thailand is small; Thailand retains some advantages to attract investment, including improved fiber connectivity and international bandwidth; increasing submarine capacity, such as the SJC2 cable to come online later in 2022, will considerably improve Thailand’s potential as a regional hub (2022)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>

1932

since 2004, the military has fought against separatist insurgents
in the southern provinces of Pattani, Yala, and Narathiwat, as well
as parts of Songkhla; the insurgency is rooted in ethnic Malay
nationalist resistance to Thai rule that followed the extension of
Siamese sovereignty over the Patani Sultanate in the 18th century;
the insurgency consists of several armed groups, the largest of
which is the Barisan Revolusi Nasional-Koordinasi (BRN-C): since
2020, the Thai military has been negotiating with BRN, and has
parallel talks with an umbrella organization, MARA Pattani, that
claims to represent the insurgency groups; since 2004, violence
associated with the insurgency has claimed more than 7,300 lives
(as of 2023); the Thai Government has had as many as 100,000
military and paramilitary forces deployed in the south to combat
the insurgency

Thailand has Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA) status with the US; MNNA is
a designation under US law that provides foreign partners with
certain benefits in the areas of defense trade and security
cooperation; while MNNA status provides military and economic
privileges, it does not entail any security commitments (2023)</subsection>
