   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">In 788, about a century after the Arab conquest of North Africa,
a series of Moroccan Muslim dynasties began to rule in Morocco. In
the 16th century, the Sa'adi monarchy, particularly under Ahmad
al-MANSUR (1578-1603), repelled foreign invaders and inaugurated a
golden age. The Alaouite Dynasty, to which the current Moroccan
royal family belongs, dates from the 17th century. In 1860, Spain
occupied northern Morocco and ushered in a half-century of trade
rivalry among European powers that saw Morocco's sovereignty
steadily erode; in 1912, the French imposed a protectorate over the
country. A protracted independence struggle with France ended
successfully in 1956. The internationalized city of Tangier and
most Spanish possessions were turned over to the new country that
same year. Sultan MOHAMMED V, the current monarch's grandfather,
organized the new state as a constitutional monarchy and in 1957
assumed the title of king. Since Spain's 1976 withdrawal from
Western Sahara, Morocco has extended its de facto administrative
control to roughly 75% of this territory; however, the UN does not
recognize Morocco as the administering power for Western Sahara.
The UN since 1991 has monitored a cease-fire between Morocco and
the Polisario Front - an organization advocating the territory’s
independence - and restarted negotiations over the status of the
territory in December 2018. On 10 December 2020, the US recognized
Morocco's sovereignty over all of Western Sahara.King MOHAMMED VI in early 2011 responded to the spread of
pro-democracy protests in the North Africa region by implementing a
reform program that included a new constitution, passed by popular
referendum in July 2011, under which some new powers were extended
to parliament and the prime minister, but ultimate authority
remains in the hands of the monarch. In November 2011, the Justice
and Development Party (PJD) - a moderate Islamist party - won the
largest number of seats in parliamentary elections, becoming the
first Islamist party to lead the Moroccan Government. In September
2015, Morocco held its first direct elections for regional
councils, one of the reforms included in the 2011 constitution. The
PJD again won the largest number of seats in nationwide
parliamentary elections in October 2016, but it lost its plurality
to the probusiness National Rally of Independents (RNI) in
September 2021. In December 2020, Morocco signed a normalization
agreement with Israel, similar to those that Bahrain, the United
Arab Emirates, and Sudan had concluded with Israel earlier in
2020.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Morocco is undergoing a demographic transition. Its population
is growing but at a declining rate, as people live longer and women
have fewer children. Infant, child, and maternal mortality rates
have been reduced through better health care, nutrition, hygiene,
and vaccination coverage, although disparities between urban and
rural and rich and poor households persist. Morocco’s shrinking
child cohort reflects the decline of its total fertility rate from
5 in mid-1980s to 2.2 in 2010, which is a result of increased
female educational attainment, higher contraceptive use, delayed
marriage, and the desire for smaller families. Young adults
(persons aged 15-29) make up almost 26% of the total population and
represent a potential economic asset if they can be gainfully
employed. Currently, however, many youths are unemployed because
Morocco’s job creation rate has not kept pace with the growth of
its working-age population. Most youths who have jobs work in the
informal sector with little security or benefits.During the second half of the 20th century, Morocco became one
of the world’s top emigration countries, creating large, widely
dispersed migrant communities in Western Europe. The Moroccan
Government has encouraged emigration since its independence in
1956, both to secure remittances for funding national development
and as an outlet to prevent unrest in rebellious (often Berber)
areas. Although Moroccan labor migrants earlier targeted Algeria
and France, the flood of Moroccan "guest workers" from the
mid-1960s to the early 1970s spread widely across northwestern
Europe to fill unskilled jobs in the booming manufacturing, mining,
construction, and agriculture industries. Host societies and most
Moroccan migrants expected this migration to be temporary, but
deteriorating economic conditions in Morocco related to the 1973
oil crisis and tighter European immigration policies resulted in
these stays becoming permanent.A wave of family migration followed in the 1970s and 1980s, with
a growing number of second generation Moroccans opting to become
naturalized citizens of their host countries. Spain and Italy
emerged as new destination countries in the mid-1980s, but their
introduction of visa restrictions in the early 1990s pushed
Moroccans increasingly to migrate either legally by marrying
Moroccans already in Europe or illegally to work in the underground
economy. Women began to make up a growing share of these labor
migrants. At the same time, some higher-skilled Moroccans went to
the US and Quebec, Canada.In the mid-1990s, Morocco developed into a transit country for
asylum seekers from Sub-Saharan Africa and illegal labor migrants
from Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia trying to reach Europe via
southern Spain, Spain’s Canary Islands, or Spain’s North African
enclaves, Ceuta and Melilla. Forcible expulsions by Moroccan and
Spanish security forces have not deterred these illegal migrants or
calmed Europe’s security concerns. Rabat remains unlikely to adopt
an EU agreement to take back third-country nationals who have
entered the EU illegally via Morocco. Thousands of other illegal
migrants have chosen to stay in Morocco until they earn enough
money for further travel or permanently as a "second-best" option.
The launching of a regularization program in 2014 legalized the
status of some migrants and granted them equal access to education,
health care, and work, but xenophobia and racism remain
obstacles.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: despite Morocco's economic
progress, the country suffers from high unemployment and illiteracy
affecting telecom market, particularly in rural areas; national
network nearly 100% digital using fiber-optic links; improved rural
service employs microwave radio relay; one of the most
state-of-the-art markets in Africa; high mobile penetration rates
in the region with low cost for broadband Internet access;
improvement in LTE reach and capabilities; service providers have
all successfully completed 5G proofs of concept and are currently
lining up 5G equipment providers for both radio and core
technology; regulatory agency expects to conduct the 5G spectrum
auction in 2023; mobile Internet accounts for 93% of all Internet
connections; World Bank provided funds for Morocco’s digital
transformation; government supported digital education during
pandemic; submarine cables and satellite provide connectivity to
Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and Australia (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line teledensity is just over 6
per 100 persons and mobile-cellular subscribership is nearly 134
per 100 persons; good system composed of open-wire lines, cables,
and microwave radio relay links; principal switching centers are
Casablanca and Rabat (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 212; landing point

Europe and Australia; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat
(Atlantic Ocean) and 1 Arabsat; microwave radio relay to Gibraltar,
Spain, and Western Sahara (2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
