   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Senegal is one of the few countries in the world with evidence
of continuous human life from the Paleolithic era to present.
Between the 14th and 16th centuries, the Jolof Empire ruled most of
Senegal. Starting in the 15th century, Portugal, the Netherlands,
France, and Great Britain traded along the Senegalese coast.
Senegal’s location on the western tip of Africa made it a favorable
base for the European slave trade. European powers used the
Senegalese island of Goree as a base to purchase slaves from the
warring chiefdoms on the mainland, and at the height of the slave
trade in Senegal, over one-third of the Senegalese population was
enslaved. In 1815, France abolished slavery and began expanding
inland. During the second half of the 19th century, France took
possession of Senegal as a French colony. In 1959, the French
colonies of Senegal and French Sudan were merged and granted
independence in 1960 as the Mali Federation. The union broke up
after only a few months. In 1982, Senegal joined with The Gambia to
form the nominal confederation of Senegambia. The envisaged
integration of the two countries was never implemented, and the
union dissolved in 1989.<br/>
         <br/>
Since the 1980s, the Movement of Democratic Forces in the Casamance
- a separatist movement based in southern Senegal - has led a
low-level insurgency. Several attempts at reaching a comprehensive
peace agreement have failed. Since 2012, despite sporadic incidents
of violence, an unofficial cease-fire has remained largely in
effect. Senegal is one of the most stable democracies in Africa and
has a long history of participating in international peacekeeping
and regional mediation. The Socialist Party of Senegal ruled for 40
years until Abdoulaye WADE was elected president in 2000 and
re-elected in 2007. WADE amended Senegal's constitution over a
dozen times to increase executive power and weaken the opposition.
In 2012, WADE’s decision to run for a third presidential term
sparked public backlash that led to his defeat to current President
Macky SALL. A 2016 constitutional referendum limited future
presidents to two consecutive five-year terms. The change, however,
does not apply to SALL's first term. In February 2019, SALL won his
bid for reelection; his second term will end in 2024.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Senegal has a large and growing youth population but has not
been successful in developing its potential human capital.
Senegal’s high total fertility rate of almost 4.5 children per
woman continues to bolster the country’s large youth cohort – more
than 60% of the population is under the age of 25. Fertility
remains high because of the continued desire for large families,
the low use of family planning, and early childbearing. Because of
the country’s high illiteracy rate (more than 40%), high
unemployment (even among university graduates), and widespread
poverty, Senegalese youths face dim prospects; women are especially
disadvantaged.Senegal historically was a destination country for economic
migrants, but in recent years West African migrants more often use
Senegal as a transit point to North Africa – and sometimes
illegally onward to Europe. The country also has been host to
several thousand black Mauritanian refugees since they were
expelled from their homeland during its 1989 border conflict with
Senegal. The country’s economic crisis in the 1970s stimulated
emigration; departures accelerated in the 1990s. Destinations
shifted from neighboring countries, which were experiencing
economic decline, civil wars, and increasing xenophobia, to Libya
and Mauritania because of their booming oil industries and to
developed countries (most notably former colonial ruler France, as
well as Italy and Spain). The latter became attractive in the 1990s
because of job opportunities and their periodic regularization
programs (legalizing the status of illegal migrants). </subsection>

note: on 21 March 2022, the US Centers for Disease

Africa; Senegal is currently considered a high risk to travelers
for circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV);
vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) is a strain of the weakened
poliovirus that was initially included in oral polio vaccine (OPV)

or naturally occurring virus; this means it can be spread more
easily to people who are unvaccinated against polio and who come in
contact with the stool or respiratory secretions, such as from a
sneeze, of an “infected” person who received oral polio vaccine;
the CDC recommends that before any international travel, anyone
unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated, or with an unknown polio
vaccination status should complete the routine polio vaccine
series; before travel to any high-risk destination, the CDC
recommends that adults who previously completed the full, routine
polio vaccine series receive a single, lifetime booster dose of

continues to show steady growth in all sectors; this has been
supported by the particular demands made on consumers during the
pandemic, which resulted in a particularly strong increase in the
number of subscribers; the mobile subscriber base increased 6.7% in
2020, year-on-year, and by 4.1% in 2021, while the number of fixed
broadband subscribers increased 17.5% year-on-year in 2021; mobile
internet platforms account for the vast majority of all internet
accesses; quality of service issues continue to plague the market,
with the regulator periodically issuing fines to the market players
(2022)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: generally reliable urban system with a
fiber-optic network; about two-thirds of all fixed-line connections
are in Dakar; mobile-cellular service is steadily displacing

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

      <subsection title="Trafficking in persons">tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List — Senegal does
not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of
trafficking but is making significant efforts to do so; efforts
include establishing an anti-trafficking database; planning the
third phase of its program to remove vulnerable children, including
trafficking victims, from the streets of major cities; launching an
emergency campaign to place vulnerable children and forced begging
victims in shelters due to COVID 19 pandemic; however, the
government rarely proactively investigated or prosecuted
traffickers exploiting children in forced begging; authorities did
not take action against officials who refused to investigate such
cases; officials only applied adequate prison terms in accordance
with the 2005 anti-trafficking law to two convicted traffickers;
authorities did not identify any adult trafficking victims;
government officials continued to have a limited knowledge of
trafficking; Senegal was downgraded to Tier 2 Watch List
(2020)<br/>
         <br/>
trafficking profile: Senegal is a source, transit,
and destination country for children and women who are subjected to
forced begging, forced labor, and sex trafficking; traffickers
subject Senegalese children to forced labor in domestic service,
mining, and prostitution; some Senegalese boys from Quranic schools
and boys from The Gambia, Mali, Guinea-Bissau, and Guinea are
forced to beg; Senegalese women and girls are forced into domestic
servitude in neighboring countries, Europe, and the Middle East,
while others are sexually exploited in Senegal; women and girls
from other West African countries are subjected to domestic
servitude and sexual exploitation in Senegal; Ukrainian and Chinese
women are exploited for sex trafficking in bars and nightclubs;
North Korean workers are forced to work in construction</subsection>
