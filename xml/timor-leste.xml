   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Timor was actively involved in Southeast Asian trading networks
for centuries, and by the 14th century exported aromatic
sandalwood, slaves, honey, and wax. A number of local chiefdoms
ruled the island in the early 16th century when Portuguese traders
arrived, chiefly attracted by the relative abundance of sandalwood
on Timor; by mid-century, the Portuguese had colonized the island.
Skirmishing with the Dutch in the region eventually resulted in an
1859 treaty in which Portugal ceded the western portion of the
island. Imperial Japan occupied Portuguese Timor from 1942 to 1945,
but Portugal resumed colonial authority after the Japanese defeat
in World War II. East Timor declared itself independent from
Portugal on 28 November 1975 and was invaded and occupied by
Indonesian forces nine days later. It was incorporated into
Indonesia in July 1976 as the province of Timor Timur (East Timor).
An unsuccessful campaign of pacification followed over the next two
decades, during which an estimated 100,000 to 250,000 people died.
In an August 1999 UN-supervised popular referendum, an overwhelming
majority of the people of Timor-Leste voted for independence from
Indonesia. However, in the next three weeks, anti-independence
Timorese militias - organized and supported by the Indonesian
military - commenced a large-scale, scorched-earth campaign of
retribution. The militias killed approximately 1,400 Timorese and
displaced nearly 500,000. Most of the country's infrastructure,
including homes, irrigation systems, water supply systems, and
schools, and nearly all of the country's electrical grid were
destroyed. On 20 September 1999, Australian-led peacekeeping troops
deployed to the country and brought the violence to an end. On 20
May 2002, Timor-Leste was internationally recognized as an
independent state.In 2006, internal tensions threatened the new nation's security
when a military strike led to violence and a breakdown of law and
order. At Dili's request, an Australian-led International
Stabilization Force (ISF) deployed to Timor-Leste, and the UN
Security Council established the UN Integrated Mission in
Timor-Leste (UNMIT), which included an authorized police presence
of over 1,600 personnel. The ISF and UNMIT restored stability,
allowing for presidential and parliamentary elections in 2007 in a
largely peaceful atmosphere. In 2008, rebels staged an unsuccessful
attack against the president and prime minister. Since the attack,
Timor-Leste has made considerable progress in building stability
and democratic institutions, holding a series of successful
parliamentary and presidential elections since 2012. Nonetheless,
weak and unstable political coalitions have led to periodic
episodes of political stalemate and crisis in governance. The ISF
and UNMIT departed in 2012 but the UN continues to provide
assistance on economic development and strengthening governing
institutions. Currently, Timor-Leste is one of the world's poorest
nations with an economy that relies heavily on energy resources in
the Timor Sea.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Timor-Leste’s high fertility and population growth rates sustain
its very youthful age structure – approximately 40% of the
population is below the age of 15 and the country’s median age is
20.  While Timor-Leste’s total fertility rate (TFR) – the
average number of births per woman – decreased significantly from
over 7 in the early 2000s, it remains high at 4.3 in 2021 and will
probably continue to decline slowly.  The low use of
contraceptives and the traditional preference for large families is
keeping fertility elevated.  The high TFR and falling
mortality rates continue to fuel a high population growth rate of
nearly 2.2%, which is the highest in Southeast Asia.  The
country’s high total dependency ratio – a measure of the ratio of
dependents to the working-age population – could divert more
government spending toward social programs. Timor-Leste’s growing,
poorly educated working-age population and insufficient job
creation are ongoing problems.  Some 70% of the population
lives in rural areas, where most of people are dependent on the
agricultural sector.  Malnutrition and poverty are prevalent,
with 42% of the population living under the poverty line as of
2014.During the Indonesian occupation (1975-1999) and Timor-Leste’s
fight for independence, approximately 250,000 Timorese fled to
western Timor and, in lesser numbers, Australia, Portugal, and
other countries. Many of these emigrants later returned.
 Since Timor-Leste’s 1999 independence referendum, economic
motives and periods of conflict have been the main drivers of
emigration.  Bilateral labor agreements with Australia,
Malaysia, and South Korea and the presence of Timorese populations
abroad, are pull factors, but the high cost prevents many young
Timorese from emigrating.  Timorese communities are found in
its former colonizers, Indonesia and Portugal, as well as the
Philippines and the UK.  The country has also become a
destination for migrants in the surrounding region, mainly men
seeking work in construction, commerce, and services in Dili.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Timor-Leste has been moving
forward with the regeneration of its economy and rebuilding key
infrastructure, including telecommunications networks, that were
destroyed during the years of civil unrest; fixed-line and fixed
broadband penetration in Timor-Leste remains extremely low, mainly
due to the limited fixed-line infrastructure and the proliferation
of mobile connectivity; in an effort to boost e-government
services; the number of subscribers through to 2026 is expected to
develop steadily, though from a low base; by August 2020,
Timor-Leste had three telecom service providers who jointly
achieved a 98% network coverage nationally; the mobile broadband
market is still at an early stage of development, strong growth is
predicted over the next five years; at the end of 2020, the
government issued new policy guidelines to maximize the use of
spectrum in Timor-Leste; it invited mobile operators to submit
applications for the allocation of spectrum in the 1800MHz, 2300MHz
and 2600MHz bands; in November 2020, the government approved the
deployment of a submarine fiber link connecting the south of the
country to Australia via the North Western Cable System (NWCS)
(2021)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: system suffered significant damage
during the violence associated with independence; limited
fixed-line services, less than 1 per 100 and mobile-cellular
services are now available in urban and most rural areas with
teledensity of over 104 per 100 (2020)<br/>

 international service is available; partnership with
Australia telecom companies for potential deployment of a submarine
fiber-optic link (NWCS); geostationary earth orbit

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
