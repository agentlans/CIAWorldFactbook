   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Kingdom of Yemen (colloquially known as North Yemen) became
independent from the Ottoman Empire in 1918 and in 1962 became the
Yemen Arab Republic. The British, who had set up a protectorate
area around the southern port of Aden in the 19th century, withdrew
in 1967 from what became the People's Republic of Southern Yemen
(colloquially known as South Yemen). Three years later, the
southern government adopted a Marxist orientation and changed the
country's name to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. The
massive exodus of hundreds of thousands of Yemenis from the south
to the north contributed to two decades of hostility between the
states. The two countries were formally unified as the Republic of
Yemen in 1990. A southern secessionist movement and brief civil war
in 1994 was quickly subdued. In 2000, Saudi Arabia and Yemen agreed
to delineate their border.Fighting in the northwest between the government and the Huthis,
a Zaydi Shia Muslim minority, continued intermittently from 2004 to
2010, and then again from 2014-present. The southern secessionist
movement was revitalized in 2007.Public rallies in Sana'a against then President Ali Abdallah
SALIH - inspired by similar Arab Spring demonstrations in Tunisia
and Egypt - slowly built momentum starting in late January 2011
fueled by complaints over high unemployment, poor economic
conditions, and corruption. By the following month, some protests
had resulted in violence, and the demonstrations had spread to
other major cities. By March the opposition had hardened its
demands and was unifying behind calls for SALIH's immediate ouster.
In April 2011, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), in an attempt to
mediate the crisis in Yemen, proposed the GCC Initiative, an
agreement in which the president would step down in exchange for
immunity from prosecution. SALIH's refusal to sign an agreement led
to further violence. The UN Security Council passed Resolution 2014
in October 2011 calling for an end to the violence and completing a
power transfer deal. In November 2011, SALIH signed the GCC
Initiative to step down and to transfer some of his powers to Vice
President Abd Rabuh Mansur HADI. Following HADI's uncontested
election victory in February 2012, SALIH formally transferred all
presidential powers. In accordance with the GCC Initiative, Yemen
launched a National Dialogue Conference (NDC) in March 2013 to
discuss key constitutional, political, and social issues. HADI
concluded the NDC in January 2014 and planned to begin implementing
subsequent steps in the transition process, including
constitutional drafting, a constitutional referendum, and national
elections.The Huthis, perceiving their grievances were not addressed in
the NDC, joined forces with SALIH and expanded their influence in
northwestern Yemen, which culminated in a major offensive against
military units and rival tribes and enabled their forces to overrun
the capital, Sanaa, in September 2014. In January 2015, the Huthis
surrounded the presidential palace, HADI's residence, and key
government facilities, prompting HADI and the cabinet to submit
their resignations. HADI fled to Aden in February 2015 and
rescinded his resignation. He subsequently escaped to Oman and then
moved to Saudi Arabia and asked the GCC to intervene militarily in
Yemen to protect the legitimate government from the Huthis. In
March 2015, Saudi Arabia assembled a coalition of Arab militaries
and began airstrikes against the Huthis and Huthi-affiliated
forces. Ground fighting between Huthi-aligned forces and anti-Huthi
groups backed by the Saudi-led coalition continued through 2016. In
2016, the UN brokered a months-long cessation of hostilities that
reduced airstrikes and fighting, and initiated peace talks in
Kuwait. However, the talks ended without agreement. The Huthis and
SALIH’s political party announced a Supreme Political Council in
August 2016 and a National Salvation Government, including a prime
minister and several dozen cabinet members, in November 2016, to
govern in Sanaa and further challenge the legitimacy of HADI’s
government. However, amid rising tensions between the Huthis and
SALIH, sporadic clashes erupted in mid-2017, and escalated into
open fighting that ended when Huthi forces killed SALIH in early
December 2017. In 2018, anti-Huthi forces made the most battlefield
progress in Yemen since early 2016, most notably in Al Hudaydah
Governorate. In December 2018, the Huthis and Yemeni Government
participated in the first UN-brokered peace talks since 2016,
agreeing to a limited cease-fire in Al Hudaydah Governorate and the
establishment of a UN Mission to monitor the agreement. In April
2019, Yemen’s parliament convened in Say'un for the first time
since the conflict broke out in 2014. In August 2019, violence
erupted between HADI's government and the pro-secessionist Southern
Transition Council (STC) in southern Yemen. In November 2019,
HADI's government and the STC signed a power-sharing agreement to
end the fighting between them, and in December 2020, the
signatories formed a new cabinet. In 2020 and 2021, fighting
continued on the ground in Yemen as the Huthis gained territory,
and also conducted regular UAV and missile attacks against targets
in Saudi Arabia. </subsection>

poliovirus (VDPV) is a strain of the weakened poliovirus that was
initially included in oral polio vaccine (OPV) and that has
changed over time and behaves more like the wild or naturally
occurring virus; this means it can be spread more easily to
people who are unvaccinated against polio and who come in contact
with the stool or respiratory secretions, such as from a sneeze, of
an “infected” person who received oral polio vaccine; the CDC
recommends that before any international travel, anyone
unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated, or with an unknown polio
vaccination status should complete the routine polio vaccine
series; before travel to any high-risk destination, the CDC
recommends that adults who previously completed the full, routine
polio vaccine series receive a single, lifetime booster dose of

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Yemen continues to provide
an exceptionally challenging market for telcos; civil unrest has
caused havoc and devastation across most parts of the country,
while the threat of sanctions has also made it a challenging
environment in which to operate; a large proportion of the
population requires humanitarian assistance, and there is little
disposable income for services upon which telcos can generate
revenue; essential telecom infrastructure, such as mobile towers
and fiber cabling, has often been targeted, destroyed, or damaged
by the opposing sides in the ongoing conflict; these difficulties
have proved to be a disincentive to telcos investing in
infrastructure, with the result that the country lacks basic
fixed-line infrastructure, and mobile services are based on
outdated GSM; this has prevented the development of a mobile
broadband sector, or the evolution of mobile data services; the
ownership of telecommunication services, and the scrutiny of
associated revenues and taxes, have become a political issue in
Yemen; until telecom infrastructure can be improved across Yemen,
and until civil unrest eases, there will be little progress for the
sector (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: the national network consists of
microwave radio relay, cable, tropospheric scatter, GSM and CDMA
mobile-cellular telephone systems; fixed-line teledensity remains
low by regional standards at roughly 4 per 100 but mobile cellular
use expanding at over 55 per 100 (2019)<br/>

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

         <br/>
Saudi-backed forces: paramilitary/militia border security brigades
based largely on tribal or regional affiliation (deployed along the
Saudi-Yemen border, especially the areas bordering the governorates
of Saada and Al-Jawf)<br/>
         <br/>
United Arab Emirates-backed forces include tribal and
regionally-based militia and paramilitary forces (concentrated in

auxiliary forces (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
note 1: under the 2019 Riyadh Agreement, the STC
forces were to be incorporated into Yemen’s Ministries of Defense
and Interior under the authority of the HADI
government <br/>
         <br/>
note 2: a considerable portion--up to 70 percent by some
estimates--of Yemen’s military and security forces defected in
whole or in part to former president SALAH and the Huthi opposition
in 2011-2015</subsection>
      <subsection title="Military expenditures">prior to the start of the civil war in 2014, annual military
expenditures were approximately 4-5% of Yemen's GDP </subsection>
      <subsection title="Military and security service personnel strengths">information limited and widely varied; Yemen Government: up to
300,000 estimated military, paramilitary, militia, and other
security forces; UAE- and Saudi-backed forces: estimated
150-200,000 trained militia and paramilitary fighters; Huthis: up
to 200,000 estimated fighters (2021)</subsection>
      <subsection title="Military equipment inventories and acquisitions">the inventory of the Yemeni Government forces consists primarily
of Russian and Soviet-era equipment, although much of it has been
lost in the current conflict; since the start of the civil war in
2014, it has received limited amounts of donated equipment from
some Gulf States, including Saudi Arabia and UAE<br/>
         <br/>
Huthi forces are armed largely with weapons seized from Yemeni
Government forces; they are also reported to have received military
hardware from Iran (2022)</subsection>
      <subsection title="Military service age and obligation">18 is the legal minimum age for voluntary military service;
conscription abolished in 2001; 2-year service obligation (note -

      <subsection title="Military - note">in 2015, a Saudi-led coalition of Arab states intervened
militarily in Yemen in support of the Republic of Yemen Government
against the separatist Huthis; as of 2022, Saudi military forces
continued to conduct operations in Yemen; Saudi Arabia also has
raised and equipped paramilitary/militia security forces in Yemen
based largely on tribal or regional affiliation to deploy along the
Saudi-Yemen border, especially the areas bordering the governorates
of Saada and Al-Jawf<br/>
         <br/>
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) intervened in Yemen in 2015 as part
of the Saudi-led coalition with about 3,500 troops, as well as
supporting air and naval forces; UAE withdrew its main military
force from Yemen in 2019, but has retained a smaller military
presence while working with proxies in southern Yemen, most notably
the Southern Transitional Council (STC); as of 2021, UAE had
recruited, trained, and equipped an estimated 150-200,000 Yemeni
fighters and formed them into dozens of militia and paramilitary
units<br/>
         <br/>
Iran has provided some military and political support to the Huthis
