   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Following World War I, France acquired a mandate over the
northern portion of the former Ottoman Empire province of Syria.
The French administered the area as Syria until granting it
independence in 1946. The new country lacked political stability
and experienced a series of military coups. Syria united with Egypt
in February 1958 to form the United Arab Republic. In September
1961, the two entities separated, and the Syrian Arab Republic was
reestablished. In the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, Syria lost the Golan
Heights region to Israel. During the 1990s, Syria and Israel held
occasional, albeit unsuccessful, peace talks over its return. In
November 1970, Hafiz al-ASAD, a member of the socialist Ba'ath
Party and the minority Alawi sect, seized power in a bloodless coup
and brought political stability to the country. Following the death
of President Hafiz al-ASAD, his son, Bashar al-ASAD, was approved
as president by popular referendum in July 2000. Syrian troops -
stationed in Lebanon since 1976 in an ostensible peacekeeping role
- were withdrawn in April 2005. During the July-August 2006
conflict between Israel and Hizballah, Syria placed its military
forces on alert but did not intervene directly on behalf of its
ally Hizballah. In May 2007, Bashar al-ASAD's second term as
president was approved by popular referendum.Influenced by major uprisings that began elsewhere in the
region, and compounded by additional social and economic factors,
antigovernment protests broke out first in the southern province of
Dar'a in March 2011 with protesters calling for the repeal of the
restrictive Emergency Law allowing arrests without charge, the
legalization of political parties, and the removal of corrupt local
officials. Demonstrations and violent unrest spread across Syria
with the size and intensity of protests fluctuating. The government
responded to unrest with a mix of concessions - including the
repeal of the Emergency Law, new laws permitting new political
parties, and liberalizing local and national elections - and with
military force and detentions. The government's efforts to quell
unrest and armed opposition activity led to extended clashes and
eventually civil war between government forces, their allies, and
oppositionists.International pressure on the ASAD regime intensified after late
2011, as the Arab League, the EU, Turkey, and the US expanded
economic sanctions against the regime and those entities that
support it. In December 2012, the Syrian National Coalition, was
recognized by more than 130 countries as the sole legitimate
representative of the Syrian people. In September 2015, Russia
launched a military intervention on behalf of the ASAD regime, and
domestic and foreign government-aligned forces recaptured swaths of
territory from opposition forces, and eventually the country’s
second largest city, Aleppo, in December 2016, shifting the
conflict in the regime’s favor. The regime, with this foreign
support, also recaptured opposition strongholds in the Damascus
suburbs and the southern province of Dar’a in 2018. The government
lacks territorial control over much of the northeastern part of the
country, which is dominated by the predominantly Kurdish Syrian
Democratic Forces (SDF), and a smaller area dominated by Turkey.
The SDF expanded its territorial hold beyond its traditional
homelands, subsuming much of the northeast since 2014 as it battled
the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Since 2016, Turkey has been
engaged in northern Syria and has conducted three large-scale
military operations to capture territory along Syria's northern
border in the provinces of Aleppo, Ar Raqqah, and Al Hasakah. Some
opposition forces organized under the Turkish-backed Syrian
National Army and Turkish forces have maintained control of
northwestern Syria along the Turkish border with the Afrin area of
Aleppo Province since 2018. In 2019, Turkey and its opposition
allies occupied formerly SDF-controlled territory between the
cities of Tall Abyad to Ra’s Al ‘Ayn along Syria’s northern border.
The extremist organization Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (formerly the
Nusrah Front) in 2017 emerged as the predominate opposition force
in Idlib Province, and still dominates an area also hosting
additional Turkish forces. Negotiations between the government and
opposition delegations at UN-sponsored Geneva conferences since
2014 and separately held discussions between Iran, Russia, and
Turkey since early 2017 have failed to produce a resolution to the
conflict. According to a September 2021 UN estimate, the death toll
resulting from the past 10 years of civil war is more than 350,000,
although the UN acknowledges that this is the minimum number of
verifiable deaths and is an undercount. According to a June 2022 UN
estimate, the death toll resulting from the past 10 plus years of
civil war is more than 306,000. As of early 2022, approximately
6.66 million Syrians were internally displaced and 14.6 million
people were in need of humanitarian assistance across the country.
An additional 5.6 million Syrians were registered refugees in
Turkey, Jordan, Iraq, Egypt, and North Africa. The conflict in
Syria remains one of the two largest displacement crises worldwide
(the other is the invasion of Ukraine).</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">the years of civil war and destruction to infrastructure continue to have a toll on the telecoms sector in Syria; although over the years the major mobile service providers have endeavored to restore and rebuild damaged networks, the operating environment has been difficult; following disputed demands for back taxes, MTN Group in August 2021 exited the country, after its majority stake had been transferred to judicial guardianship; this effectively meant that the mobile market became a monopoly; in February 2022 the regulator awarded a third mobile license following a process which had been ongoing for many years; telecommunication services in Syria are highly regulated; although urban areas can make use of the network built and maintained by the government-owned incumbent, many under served remote areas in the countryside are obliged to rely on satellite communications; the domestic and international fixed-line markets in Syria remain the monopoly of the STE, despite several initiatives over the years aimed at liberalizing the market; mobile broadband penetration in Syria is still quite low, despite quite a high population coverage of 3G networks and some deployment of LTE infrastructure; this may provide potential opportunities for growth once infrastructure and economic reconstruction efforts make headway, and civil issues subside (2022)</note>
         <note title="domestic">the number of fixed-line connections increased markedly prior to the civil war in 2011 and now stands at over 16 per 100; mobile-cellular service is just over 95 per 100 persons (2020)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>
