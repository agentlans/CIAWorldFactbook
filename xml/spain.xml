   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Spain's powerful world empire of the 16th and 17th centuries
ultimately yielded command of the seas to England. Subsequent
failure to embrace the mercantile and industrial revolutions caused
the country to fall behind Britain, France, and Germany in economic
and political power. Spain remained neutral in World War I and II
but suffered through a devastating civil war (1936-39). A peaceful
transition to democracy following the death of dictator Francisco
FRANCO in 1975, and rapid economic modernization (Spain joined the
EU in 1986) gave Spain a dynamic and rapidly growing economy, and
made it a global champion of freedom and human rights. More
recently, Spain has emerged from a severe economic recession that
began in mid-2008, posting solid years of GDP growth above the EU
average. Unemployment has fallen but remains high, especially among
youth. Spain is the euro-zone's fourth-largest economy. The country
has faced increased domestic turmoil in recent years due to the
independence movement in its restive Catalonia region.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">Spain’s telecom sector has tracked the performance of the overall economy, which has been one of the most heavily impacted by the pandemic in all of Europe; GDP dropped by 10.8% in 2020, while telecom revenue reversed the previous five years’ positive results by falling 5.3%; fixed-line services were the hardest hit, with revenue falling 13.7%; mobile voice services did not fare much better, falling 4.7%; this is despite relatively small shifts in the number of subscribers, though the harsh lockdown conditions resulted in a significant drop in usage; it had appeared that a return to growth might be possible in 2021 following lifting the state of emergency in May, but the most recent surge in cases and the continued restrictions on travel may once again put the brakes on growth until at least 2022; Spain’s fixed-line broadband market managed to extend its decade-long pattern of steady growth into 2020, with a slight increase in demand caused by the need for fast internet access to support working and learning from home; while most of Spain’s larger telcos delivered negative revenue and profit in 2020 (2021)</note>

the integrated military structure until 1996; the Spanish Marine
Corps, established in 1537, is the oldest marine corps in the

13th century, that is considered the oldest still active military
unit in the western world

Spain created a Spanish Legion for foreigners in 1920, but early on
the Legion was primarily filled by native Spaniards due to
difficulties in recruiting foreigners and most of its foreign
members were from the Republic of Cuba; it was modeled after the
French Foreign Legion and its purpose was to provide a corps of
professional troops to fight in Spain's colonial campaigns in North
Africa; in more recent years, it has been used in NATO peacekeeping
deployments; today’s Legion includes a mix of native Spaniards and
foreigners with Spanish residency (2022)</subsection>
