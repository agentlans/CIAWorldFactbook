   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">After independence from Italian colonial control in 1941 and 10
years of British administrative control, the UN established Eritrea
as an autonomous region within the Ethiopian federation in 1952.
Ethiopia's full annexation of Eritrea as a province 10 years later
sparked a violent 30-year struggle for independence that ended in
1991 with Eritrean rebels defeating government forces. Eritreans
overwhelmingly approved independence in a 1993 referendum. ISAIAS
Afwerki has been Eritrea's only president since independence; his
rule, particularly since 2001, has been highly autocratic and
repressive. His government has created a highly militarized society
by pursuing an unpopular program of mandatory conscription into
national service – divided between military and civilian service –
of indefinite length. A two-and-a-half-year border war with
Ethiopia that erupted in 1998 ended under UN auspices in December
2000. A subsequent 2007 Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC)
demarcation was rejected by Ethiopia. More than a decade of a tense
“no peace, no war” stalemate ended in 2018 after the newly elected
Ethiopian prime minister accepted the EEBC’s 2007 ruling, and the
two countries signed declarations of peace and friendship.
Following the July 2018 peace agreement with Ethiopia, Eritrean
leaders engaged in intensive diplomacy around the Horn of Africa,
bolstering regional peace, security, and cooperation, as well as
brokering rapprochements between governments and opposition groups.
In November 2018, the UN Security Council lifted an arms embargo
that had been imposed on Eritrea since 2009, after the UN
Somalia-Eritrea Monitoring Group reported they had not found
evidence of Eritrean support in recent years for Al-Shabaab. The
country’s rapprochement with Ethiopia has led to a steady
resumption of economic ties, with increased air transport, trade,
tourism, and port activities, but the economy remains
agriculture-dependent, and Eritrea is still one of Africa’s poorest
nations. Despite the country's improved relations with its
neighbors, ISAIAS has not let up on repression and conscription and
militarization continue.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Eritrea is a persistently poor country that has made progress in
some socioeconomic categories but not in others. Education and
human capital formation are national priorities for facilitating
economic development and eradicating poverty. To this end, Eritrea
has made great strides in improving adult literacy – doubling the
literacy rate over the last 20 years – in large part because of its
successful adult education programs. The overall literacy rate was
estimated to be more than 75% in 2018; more work needs to be done
to raise female literacy and school attendance among nomadic and
rural communities. Subsistence farming fails to meet the needs of
Eritrea’s growing population because of repeated droughts,
dwindling arable land, overgrazing, soil erosion, and a shortage of
farmers due to conscription and displacement. The government’s
emphasis on spending on defense over agriculture and its lack of
foreign exchange to import food also contribute to food
insecurity.Eritrea has been a leading refugee source country since at least
the 1960s, when its 30-year war for independence from Ethiopia
began. Since gaining independence in 1993, Eritreans have continued
migrating to Sudan, Ethiopia, Yemen, Egypt, or Israel because of a
lack of basic human rights or political freedom, educational and
job opportunities, or to seek asylum because of militarization.
Eritrea’s large diaspora has been a source of vital remittances,
funding its war for independence and providing 30% of the country’s
GDP annually since it became independent.In the last few years, Eritreans have increasingly been
trafficked and held hostage by Bedouins in the Sinai Desert, where
they are victims of organ harvesting, rape, extortion, and torture.
Some Eritrean trafficking victims are kidnapped after being
smuggled to Sudan or Ethiopia, while others are kidnapped from
within or around refugee camps or crossing Eritrea’s borders.
Eritreans composed approximately 90% of the conservatively
estimated 25,000-30,000 victims of Sinai trafficking from
2009-2013, according to a 2013 consultancy firm report.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Flag description">red isosceles triangle (based on the hoist side) dividing the
flag into two right triangles; the upper triangle is green, the
lower one is blue; a gold wreath encircling a gold olive branch is
centered on the hoist side of the red triangle; green stands for
the country's agriculture economy, red signifies the blood shed in
the fight for freedom, and blue symbolizes the bounty of the sea;
the wreath-olive branch symbol is similar to that on the first flag
of Eritrea from 1952; the shape of the red triangle broadly mimics
the shape of the country<br/>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Eritrea’s telecom sector
operates under a state-owned monopoly for fixed and mobile
services; as a result of such restrictions on competition, the
country has the least developed telecommunications market in
Africa; mobile penetration stands at only about 20%, while
fixed-line internet use barely registers; this is exacerbated by
the very low use of computers, with only about 4% of households
having a computer, and most of these being in the capital, Asmara;
the 3G network continues to rollout which provides basic internet
access to the majority or Eritreans; investment in telecom
infrastructure is still required to improve the quality of
services; the government has embarked on a work program to do
exactly that, specifically aimed at extending services to remote
areas, improving the quality of services, and ensuring that more
telecoms infrastructure is supported by solar power to compensate
for the poor state of the electricity network; additional foreign
investment in telecom infrastructure, as well as introduction of
more competition, would help transform what remains a virtually
untapped market (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line subscribership is less than 2
per 100 persons and mobile-cellular is just over 51 per 100

international: country code - 291 (2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and
is not making significant efforts to do so; the government engaged
in critical bilateral and multilateral partnerships to build its
capacity for anti-trafficking initiatives; officials participated
in a UN-sponsored regional anti-trafficking workshop and committed
to produce a regional plan of action to combat trafficking;
however, a government policy or pattern of forced labor existed;
the government continued to subject its nationals to forced labor
in its compulsory national service and citizen militia by forcing
them to serve indefinitely or for arbitrary periods; authorities
did not report any trafficking investigations, prosecutions, or
convictions, including complicit government employees, nor did they
report identifying victims and referring them to care; the
government has no action plan to combat human trafficking
(2020)<br/>
         <br/>
trafficking profile: human traffickers export
domestic victims in Eritrea or abroad; National Service is
mandatory at age 18 and may take a variety of forms, including
military service and physical labor but also government office jobs
and teaching; Eritreans who flee the country, usually with the aim
of reaching Europe, seek the help of paid smugglers and are
vulnerable to trafficking when they cross the border clandestinely
into Sudan, Ethiopia, and to a lesser extent Djibouti; Eritreans
are subject to forced labor and sex trafficking mainly in Sudan,
Ethiopia, and Libya</subsection>
