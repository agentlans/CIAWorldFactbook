   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">After independence from Italian colonial control in 1941 and 10
years of British administrative control, the UN established Eritrea
as an autonomous region within the Ethiopian federation in 1952.
Ethiopia's full annexation of Eritrea as a province 10 years later
sparked a violent 30-year struggle for independence that ended in
1991 with Eritrean rebels defeating government forces. Eritreans
overwhelmingly approved independence in a 1993 referendum. ISAIAS
Afwerki has been Eritrea's only president since independence; his
rule, particularly since 2001, has been highly autocratic and
repressive. His government has created a highly militarized society
by pursuing an unpopular program of mandatory conscription into
national service – divided between military and civilian service –
of indefinite length. A two-and-a-half-year border war with
Ethiopia that erupted in 1998 ended under UN auspices in December
2000. A subsequent 2007 Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC)
demarcation was rejected by Ethiopia. More than a decade of a tense
“no peace, no war” stalemate ended in 2018 after the newly elected
Ethiopian prime minister accepted the EEBC’s 2007 ruling, and the
two countries signed declarations of peace and friendship.
Following the July 2018 peace agreement with Ethiopia, Eritrean
leaders engaged in intensive diplomacy around the Horn of Africa,
bolstering regional peace, security, and cooperation, as well as
brokering rapprochements between governments and opposition groups.
In November 2018, the UN Security Council lifted an arms embargo
that had been imposed on Eritrea since 2009, after the UN
Somalia-Eritrea Monitoring Group reported they had not found
evidence of Eritrean support in recent years for Al-Shabaab. The
country’s rapprochement with Ethiopia has led to a steady
resumption of economic ties, with increased air transport, trade,
tourism, and port activities, but the economy remains
agriculture-dependent, and Eritrea is still one of Africa’s poorest
nations. Despite the country's improved relations with its
neighbors, ISAIAS has not let up on repression and conscription and
militarization continue.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Eritrea is a persistently poor country that has made progress in
some socioeconomic categories but not in others. Education and
human capital formation are national priorities for facilitating
economic development and eradicating poverty. To this end, Eritrea
has made great strides in improving adult literacy – doubling the
literacy rate over the last 20 years – in large part because of its
successful adult education programs. The overall literacy rate was
estimated to be more than 75% in 2018; more work needs to be done
to raise female literacy and school attendance among nomadic and
rural communities. Subsistence farming fails to meet the needs of
Eritrea’s growing population because of repeated droughts,
dwindling arable land, overgrazing, soil erosion, and a shortage of
farmers due to conscription and displacement. The government’s
emphasis on spending on defense over agriculture and its lack of
foreign exchange to import food also contribute to food
insecurity.Eritrea has been a leading refugee source country since at least
the 1960s, when its 30-year war for independence from Ethiopia
began. Since gaining independence in 1993, Eritreans have continued
migrating to Sudan, Ethiopia, Yemen, Egypt, or Israel because of a
lack of basic human rights or political freedom, educational and
job opportunities, or to seek asylum because of militarization.
Eritrea’s large diaspora has been a source of vital remittances,
funding its war for independence and providing 30% of the country’s
GDP annually since it became independent.In the last few years, Eritreans have increasingly been
trafficked and held hostage by Bedouins in the Sinai Desert, where
they are victims of organ harvesting, rape, extortion, and torture.
Some Eritrean trafficking victims are kidnapped after being
smuggled to Sudan or Ethiopia, while others are kidnapped from
within or around refugee camps or crossing Eritrea’s borders.
Eritreans composed approximately 90% of the conservatively
estimated 25,000-30,000 victims of Sinai trafficking from
2009-2013, according to a 2013 consultancy firm report.</subsection>

flag into two right triangles; the upper triangle is green, the
lower one is blue; a gold wreath encircling a gold olive branch is
centered on the hoist side of the red triangle; green stands for
the country's agriculture economy, red signifies the blood shed in
the fight for freedom, and blue symbolizes the bounty of the sea;
the wreath-olive branch symbol is similar to that on the first flag
of Eritrea from 1952; the shape of the red triangle broadly mimics
the shape of the country

         <note title="general assessment">Eritrea’s telecom sector operates under a state-owned monopoly for fixed and mobile services; as a result of such restrictions on competition, the country has the least developed telecommunications market in Africa; mobile penetration stands at only about 20%, while fixed-line internet use barely registers; this is exacerbated by the very low use of computers, with only about 4% of households having a computer, and most of these being in the capital, Asmara; the 3G network continues to rollout which provides basic internet access to the majority or Eritreans; investment in telecom infrastructure is still required to improve the quality of services; the government has embarked on a work program to do exactly that, specifically aimed at extending services to remote areas, improving the quality of services, and ensuring that more telecoms infrastructure is supported by solar power to compensate for the poor state of the electricity network; additional foreign investment in telecom infrastructure, as well as introduction of more competition, would help transform what remains a virtually untapped market (2022)</note>
