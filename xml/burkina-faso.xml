   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Many of Burkina Faso’s ethnic groups arrived in the region
between the 12th and 15th centuries. The
Gurma and Mossi peoples established several of the largest kingdoms
in the area and used horse-mounted warriors in military campaigns.
Of the various Mossi kingdoms, the most powerful were Ouagadougou
and Yatenga. In the late 19th century, European states competed for
control of the region. France eventually conquered the area and
established it as a French protectorate. </subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Burkina Faso has a young age structure – the result of declining
mortality combined with steady high fertility – and continues to
experience rapid population growth, which is putting increasing
pressure on the country’s limited arable land. Almost 65% of the
population is under the age of 25 as of 2020, and the population is
growing at 2.5% annually. Mortality rates, especially those of
infants and children, have decreased because of improved health
care, hygiene, and sanitation, but women continue to have an
average of more than 4 children. Even if fertility were
substantially reduced, today’s large cohort entering their
reproductive years would sustain high population growth for the
foreseeable future. Only about a third of the population is
literate and unemployment is widespread, dampening the economic
prospects of Burkina Faso’s large working-age population.Migration has traditionally been a way of life for Burkinabe,
with seasonal migration being replaced by stints of up to two years
abroad. Cote d’Ivoire remains the top destination, although it has
experienced periods of internal conflict. Under French
colonization, Burkina Faso became a main labor source for
agricultural and factory work in Cote d’Ivoire. Burkinabe also
migrated to Ghana, Mali, and Senegal for work between the world
wars. Burkina Faso attracts migrants from Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, and
Mali, who often share common ethnic backgrounds with the Burkinabe.
Despite its food shortages and high poverty rate, Burkina Faso has
become a destination for refugees in recent years and hosts about
33,600 Malian refugees as of October 2022.</subsection>

<note title="note">Burkina Faso is part of a four (formerly five)-nation anti-jihadist task force known as the G4 Sahel Group, set up in 2014 with Chad, Mali (withdrew in 2022), Mauritania, and Niger; it has committed 550 troops and 100 gendarmes to the force; as of 2020, defense forces from each of the participating states were allowed to pursue terrorist fighters up to 100 km into neighboring countries; the force is backed by France, the UN, and the US</note>

      <subsection title="Military - note">the FABF has a history of interference in the country’s
politics, having conducted eight coups since 1960, including the
most recent in September of 2022; its primary operational focus is
internal security, and it is actively engaged in combat operations
with terrorist groups linked to al-Qa'ida and the Islamic State of
Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS), particularly in the northern and eastern
regions; the FABF is struggling to contain the groups, however, and
a large portion of the country—40% by some estimates—is not under
government control

in the north, Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), a
coalition of al-Qa'ida linked militant groups, has exploited ethnic
tensions and perceptions of state neglect, as well as grievances
over corruption, patronage politics, social stratification, and
land disputes; in 2022, JNIM conducted attacks in 10 of the
country's 13 provinces; most of the attacks were assessed to be by
the Macina Liberation Front (FLM) of the JNIM coalition; the
ISIS-Greater Sahara (ISIS-GS) terrorist group operated in the
eastern part of the country (2023)</subsection>
