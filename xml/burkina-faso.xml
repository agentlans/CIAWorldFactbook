   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Many of Burkina Faso’s ethnic groups arrived in the region
between the 12th and 15th centuries. The
Gurma and Mossi peoples established several of the largest kingdoms
in the area and used horse-mounted warriors in military campaigns.
Of the various Mossi kingdoms, the most powerful were Ouagadougou
and Yatenga. In the late 19th century, European states competed for
control of the region. France eventually conquered the area and
established it as a French protectorate.<br/>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Burkina Faso has a young age structure – the result of declining
mortality combined with steady high fertility – and continues to
experience rapid population growth, which is putting increasing
pressure on the country’s limited arable land. Almost 65% of the
population is under the age of 25 as of 2020, and the population is
growing at 2.5% annually. Mortality rates, especially those of
infants and children, have decreased because of improved health
care, hygiene, and sanitation, but women continue to have an
average of more than 4 children. Even if fertility were
substantially reduced, today’s large cohort entering their
reproductive years would sustain high population growth for the
foreseeable future. Only about a third of the population is
literate and unemployment is widespread, dampening the economic
prospects of Burkina Faso’s large working-age population.Migration has traditionally been a way of life for Burkinabe,
with seasonal migration being replaced by stints of up to two years
abroad. Cote d’Ivoire remains the top destination, although it has
experienced periods of internal conflict. Under French
colonization, Burkina Faso became a main labor source for
agricultural and factory work in Cote d’Ivoire. Burkinabe also
migrated to Ghana, Mali, and Senegal for work between the world
wars. Burkina Faso attracts migrants from Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, and
Mali, who often share common ethnic backgrounds with the Burkinabe.
Despite its food shortages and high poverty rate, Burkina Faso has
become a destination for refugees in recent years and hosts about
33,600 Malian refugees as of October 2022.</subsection>

note: on 21 March 2022, the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Travel Alert for polio in
Africa; Burkina Faso is currently considered a high risk to
travelers for circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV);
vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) is a strain of the weakened
poliovirus that was initially included in oral polio vaccine (OPV)
and that has changed over time and behaves more like the wild
or naturally occurring virus; this means it can be spread more
easily to people who are unvaccinated against polio and who come in
contact with the stool or respiratory secretions, such as from a
sneeze, of an “infected” person who received oral polio vaccine;
the CDC recommends that before any international travel, anyone
unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated, or with an unknown polio
vaccination status should complete the routine polio vaccine
series; before travel to any high-risk destination, the CDC
recommends that adults who previously completed the full, routine
polio vaccine series receive a single, lifetime booster dose of

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Burkina Faso’s telecom
sector in recent years has made some gains in providing the
necessary infrastructure and bandwidth to support telecom services;
an IXP completed in September 2020 increased international
bandwidth capacity by a third, while in mid-2021 the government was
able to start the second phase of a national fiber backbone
project; this will link the capital city to an addition 145
municipalities, and provide additional connectivity to terrestrial
cables in neighboring countries; the activities of the militants in
side areas of the country jeopardize overall security, and render
it difficult for the telcos to safeguard their networks and
equipment; Burkina Faso joins G5 Sahel countries to eliminate
roaming fees (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line connections stand at less
than 1 per 100 persons; mobile-cellular usage nearly 106 per 100,
with multiple providers there is competition and the hope for
growth from a low base; Internet penetration is 16% (2020)<br/>

international: country code - 226; satellite earth
station - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

of the Ministry of Security and the Ministry of Justice;
Gendarmerie troops are typically integrated with Army forces in
anti-terrorism operations<br/>
         <br/>
note 2: the VDP is a civilian defense force
established in 2019 to act as auxiliaries to the Army in the fight
against militants; the volunteers receive two weeks of training and

note: Burkina Faso is part of a four (formerly
five)-nation anti-jihadist task force known as the G4 Sahel Group,
set up in 2014 with Chad, Mali (withdrew in 2022), Mauritania, and
Niger; it has committed 550 troops and 100 gendarmes to the force;
as of 2020, defense forces from each of the participating states
were allowed to pursue terrorist fighters up to 100 km into
neighboring countries; the force is backed by France, the UN, and
the US</subsection>
      <subsection title="Military - note">the FABF has a history of interference in the country’s
politics, having conducted eight coups since 1960, including the
most recent in September of 2022; its primary operational focus is
internal security, and it is actively engaged in combat operations
with terrorist groups linked to al-Qa'ida and the Islamic State of
Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS), particularly in the northern and eastern
regions; the FABF is struggling to contain the groups, however, and
a large portion of the country—40% by some estimates—is not under
government control<br/>
         <br/>
in the north, Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), a
coalition of al-Qa'ida linked militant groups, has exploited ethnic
tensions and perceptions of state neglect, as well as grievances
over corruption, patronage politics, social stratification, and
land disputes; in 2022, JNIM conducted attacks in 10 of the
country's 13 provinces; most of the attacks were assessed to be by
the Macina Liberation Front (FLM) of the JNIM coalition; the
ISIS-Greater Sahara (ISIS-GS) terrorist group operated in the
eastern part of the country (2023)</subsection>
