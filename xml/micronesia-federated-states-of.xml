   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Each of the four states that compose the Federated States of
Micronesia (FSM) - Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei, and Yap - has its own
unique history and cultural traditions. The first humans arrived in
what is now the FSM in the second millennium B.C. In the 800s A.D.,
construction of the artificial islets at the Nan Madol complex in
Pohnpei began, with the main architecture being built around 1200.
At its height, Nan Madol united the approximately 25,000 people of
Pohnpei under the Saudeleur Dynasty. Around the same time, Kosrae
was united in a kingdom centered in Leluh by 1250. Yap’s society
became strictly hierarchical, with chiefs receiving tributes from
islands up to 1,100 km (700 mi) away. Widespread human settlement
in Chuuk began in the 1300s, and the different islands in the Chuuk
Lagoon were frequently at war with one another.Portuguese and Spanish explorers visited a few of the islands in
the 1500s and Spain began exerting nominal, but not day-to-day,
control over some of the islands - which they named the Caroline
Islands - in the 1600s. Christian missionaries arrived in the
1800s, in particular to Chuuk and Kosrae. By the 1870s, nearly
every Kosraean had converted to Christianity and religion continues
to play an important role in daily life on the island. In 1899,
Spain sold all of the FSM to Germany. Japan seized the islands in
1914 and was granted a League of Nations mandate to administer them
in 1920. The Japanese navy built bases across most of the islands
and headquartered their Pacific naval operations in Chuuk. The US
bombed Chuuk in 1944 during Operation Hailstone in World War II,
destroying 250 Japanese planes and 40 ships. The US military
largely bypassed the other islands in its leapfrog campaign across
the Pacific.The FSM came under US administration as part of the Trust
Territory of the Pacific Islands in 1947, which comprised six
districts: Chuuk, the Marshall Islands, the Northern Mariana
Islands, Palau, Pohnpei, and Yap; Kosrae was separated from Pohnpei
into a separate district in 1977. In 1979, Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei,
and Yap ratified the FSM Constitution and declared independence
while the other three districts opted to pursue separate political
statuses. In 1982, the FSM signed a Compact of Free Association
(COFA) with the US, which granted the FSM financial assistance and
access to many US domestic programs in exchange for exclusive US
military access and defense responsibilities; the COFA entered into
force in 1986 and its funding was renewed in 2003. There are
significant inter-island rivalries stemming from their different
histories and cultures. Chuuk, the most populous but poorest state,
has pushed for secession, but an independence referendum has been
repeatedly postponed and may not be held.

Eligible Micronesians can live, work, and study in any part of the
US and its territories without a visa - this privilege reduces
stresses on the island economy and the environment. Micronesians
serve in the US armed forces and military recruiting from the FSM,
per capita, is higher than many US states.</subsection>
