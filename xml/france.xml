   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">France today is one of the most modern countries in the world
and is a leader among European nations. It plays an influential
global role as a permanent member of the United Nations Security
Council, NATO, the G-7, the G-20, the EU, and other multilateral
organizations. France rejoined NATO's integrated military command
structure in 2009, reversing DE GAULLE's 1966 decision to withdraw
French forces from NATO. Since 1958, it has constructed a hybrid
presidential-parliamentary governing system resistant to the
instabilities experienced in earlier, more purely parliamentary
administrations. In recent decades, its reconciliation and
cooperation with Germany have proved central to the economic
integration of Europe, including the introduction of a common
currency, the euro, in January 1999. In the early 21st century,
five French overseas entities - French Guiana, Guadeloupe,
Martinique, Mayotte, and Reunion - became French regions and were
made part of France proper.</subsection>

and has not officially collected data on religious affiliation
since the 1872 national census, which complicates assessments of
France's religious composition; an 1872 law prohibiting state
authorities from collecting data on individuals' ethnicity or
religious beliefs was reaffirmed by a 1978 law emphasizing the
prohibition of the collection or exploitation of personal data
revealing an individual's race, ethnicity, or political,
philosophical, or religious opinions; a 1905 law codified France's
separation of church and state</subsection>

settlement became the Roman town of Lutetia Parisiorum (Lutetia of
the Parisii); over subsequent centuries it became Parisium and then
just Paris</subsection>

one of the largest in Europe; there is a multi-year Engage 2025
plan which is focused on growth in the developing markets, and on
the greater use of artificial intelligence and data; there are many
MVNOs in the market; LTE networks provide near universal coverage,
and carry about 95% of mobile data traffic; operators have launched
5G services, and these have been supported by the late-2020 auction
of spectrum in the 3.5GHz range; France’s fixed broadband market is
increasingly focused on fiber, which accounted for 71% of all fixed
lines at the beginning of 2021; growth in the fiber sector has been
stimulated by households securing faster data packages during the
pandemic; the number of DSL lines has fallen sharply as customers
migrate to fiber infrastructure (2021)<br/>

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

      <subsection title="Military - note">France was one of the original 12 countries to sign the North
Atlantic Treaty (also known as the Washington Treaty), which
created NATO in 1949; in 1966, President Charles DE GAULLE decided
to withdraw France from NATO’s integrated military structure,
reflecting his desire for greater military independence,
particularly vis-à-vis the US, and the refusal to integrate
France’s nuclear deterrent or accept any form of control over its
armed forces; it did, however, sign agreements with NATO setting
out procedures in the event of Soviet aggression; beginning with
the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, France distanced itself from
the 1966 decision and has regularly contributed troops to NATO’s
military operations, being one of the largest troop-contributing
states; in 2009 it officially announced its decision to fully
participate in NATO structures<br/>
         <br/>
in 2010, France and the UK signed a declaration on defense and
security cooperation that included greater military
interoperability and a Combined Joint Expeditionary Force (CJEF), a
deployable, combined Anglo-French military force for use in a wide
range of crisis scenarios, up to and including high intensity
combat operations; the CJEF has no standing forces, but would be
available at short notice for French-UK bilateral, NATO, EU, UN, or
other operations; combined training exercises began in 2011; as of
2020, the CJEF was assessed as having full operating capacity with
the ability to rapidly deploy over 10,000 personnel capable of high
intensity operations, peacekeeping, disaster relief, and
humanitarian assistance<br/>
         <br/>
the French Foreign Legion, established in 1831, is a military force

Armed Forces for service in France and abroad; the Foreign Legion
is an integrated part of the French Army and is comprised of
approximately 8,000 personnel in eight regiments, a regiment-sized
demi-brigade, a battalion-sized overseas detachment, a
battalion-sized recruiting group, and a command staff; the combat
