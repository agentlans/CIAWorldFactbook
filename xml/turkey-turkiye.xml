   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Modern Turkey was founded in 1923 from the remnants of the
defeated Ottoman Empire by national hero Mustafa KEMAL, who was
later honored with the title Ataturk or "Father of the Turks."
Under his leadership, the country adopted radical social, legal,
and political reforms. After a period of one-party rule, an
experiment with multi-party politics led to the 1950 election
victory of the opposition Democrat Party and the peaceful transfer
of power. Since then, Turkish political parties have multiplied,
but democracy has been fractured by periods of instability and
military coups (1960, 1971, 1980), which in each case eventually
resulted in a return of formal political power to civilians. In
1997, the military again helped engineer the ouster - popularly
dubbed a "post-modern coup" - of the then Islamic-oriented
government. An unsuccessful coup attempt was made in July 2016 by a
faction of the Turkish Armed Forces.Turkey intervened militarily on Cyprus in 1974 to prevent a
Greek takeover of the island and has since acted as patron state to
the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which only Turkey
recognizes. A separatist insurgency begun in 1984 by the Kurdistan
Workers' Party (PKK), a US-designated terrorist organization, has
long dominated the attention of Turkish security forces and claimed
more than 40,000 lives. In 2013, the Turkish Government and the PKK
conducted negotiations aimed at ending the violence, however
intense fighting resumed in 2015. Turkey joined the UN in 1945 and
in 1952 it became a member of NATO. In 1963, Turkey became an
associate member of the European Community; it began accession
talks with the EU in 2005. Over the past decade, economic reforms,
coupled with some political reforms, have contributed to a growing
economy, although economic growth slowed in recent years, with
occasional bouts of turmoil.From 2015 and continuing through 2016, Turkey witnessed an
uptick in terrorist violence, including major attacks in Ankara,
Istanbul, and throughout the predominantly Kurdish southeastern
region of Turkey. On 15 July 2016, elements of the Turkish Armed
forces attempted a coup that ultimately failed following widespread
popular resistance. More than 240 people were killed and over 2,000
injured when Turkish citizens took to the streets en masse to
confront the coup forces. The government accused followers of the
Fethullah Gulen transnational religious and social movement
("Hizmet") for allegedly instigating the failed coup and designates
the movement’s followers as terrorists. Since the attempted coup,
Turkish Government authorities arrested, suspended, or dismissed
more than 130,000 security personnel, journalists, judges,
academics, and civil servants due to their alleged connection to
Gulen's movement. Following the failed coup, the Turkish Government
instituted a State of Emergency from July 2016 to July 2018. The
Turkish Government conducted a referendum on 16 April 2017 in which
voters approved constitutional amendments changing Turkey from a
parliamentary to a presidential system. The amendments went into
effect fully following the presidential and parliamentary elections
in June 2018.</subsection>

connection is uncertain; in classical and medieval times, the city
was known as Ankyra (meaning "anchor" in Greek and reflecting the
city's position as a junction for multiple trade and military
routes); by about the 13th century the city began to be referred to
as Angora; following the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in
1923, the city's name became Ankara</subsection>

deployment of fiber-based broadband networks are well established,
with fiber accounting for 26.7% of all fixed broadband connections
as of early 2022; the DSL sector still dominates, accounting for
about 63% of connections, but its share is steadily declining,
year-on-year, while the number of fiber connections has grown
strongly; improved fixed and mobile infrastructure is underpinning
the country’s initiatives relating to Smart City concepts, which
have become a key area of focus for the emerging digital economy
and the transformation to a knowledge-based economy; Turkey’s
National Smart Cities Strategy and Action Plan runs through to 2023

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

      <subsection title="Military equipment inventories and acquisitions">the military's inventory is mostly comprised of a mix of
domestically produced and Western weapons systems, although in
recent years, Turkey has also acquired some Chinese, Russian, and
South Korean equipment; over the past decade, the US has been the
leading provider of armaments to Turkey; other significant
suppliers have included Germany, Italy, South Korea, and Spain;
Turkey has a robust defense industry capable of producing a range
of weapons systems for both export and internal use, including
armored vehicles, naval vessels, and unmanned aerial platforms,
although it is heavily dependent on Western technology; Turkey's
defense industry also partners with other countries for defense
production (2022)</subsection>
      <subsection title="Military service age and obligation">mandatory military service for men, age 20-41; service can be
delayed if in university or in certain professions (researchers,
professionals, and athletic, or those with artistic talents have
the right to postpone military service until the age of 35); 6-12
months service; women may volunteer (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
note 1: in 2019, a new law cut the men’s mandatory
military service period in half, as well as making paid military
service permanent; with the new system, the period of conscription
was reduced from 12 months to six months for privates and
non-commissioned soldiers (the service term for reserve officers
chosen among university or college graduates remained 12 months);
after completing six months of service, if a conscripted soldier
wants to and is suitable for extending his military service, he may
do so for an additional six months in return for a monthly salary;
under the new law, all male Turkish citizens over the age of 20 are
required to undergo a one month military training period, but they
can obtain an exemption from the remaining five months of their
mandatory service by paying 31,000 Turkish Liras<br/>

(2022)<br/>
         <br/>
note 1: between 2016 and 2020, Turkey conducted
four significant military ground campaigns in northern Syria;
Turkey also has deployed troops into northern Iraq on numerous
occasions to combat the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK), including
large operations involving thousands of troops in 2007, 2011, and
2018, and smaller-scale operations in 2021 and 2022; Turkey has
also conducted numerous air strikes in both Iraq and Syria; in
October of 2021, Turkey’s parliament extended the military’s
mandate to launch cross-border operations in Iraq and Syria by two
more years<br/>
         <br/>
note 2: in 2020, Turkey deployed hundreds of
Turkish troops and as many as 5,000 Syrian fighters to Libya to
support the Libyan Government of National Accord</subsection>
      <subsection title="Military - note">Turkey has been a member of NATO since 1952 and hosts NATO's
Land Forces Command in Izmir, as well as a NATO/US airbase at
Incirlik and a NATO missile defense radar system in eastern
Turkey<br/>
         <br/>
under a long-range (2033) strategic plan, the Turkish Armed Forces
continued efforts to modernize its equipment and force structure;
Land Forces sought to produce a 20-30% smaller, more highly trained
force characterized by greater mobility and firepower and capable
of joint and combined operations<br/>
         <br/>
the Turkish Navy is a regional naval power that wants to develop
the capability to project power beyond Turkey's coastal waters; it
is planning to launch new frigates, submarines, and a light
aircraft carrier/amphibious assault ship in the next few years,
adding to its current force of about 16 frigates and 12 submarines;
the Navy is heavily involved in NATO, multinational, and UN
operations; its roles include control of territorial waters and
security for sea lines of communications<br/>
         <br/>
the Turkish Air Force adopted an "Aerospace and Missile Defense
Concept" in 2002 and is developing an integrated missile defense
system; in a controversial move that complicated its relationship
with NATO and the US, it purchased the Russian S-400 air defense
system for an estimated $2.5 billion in 2019; Air Force priorities
include attaining a modern deployable, survivable, and sustainable
force structure, and establishing a sustainable command and control
system<br/>
         <br/>
in recent years, Turkey has taken on a greater level of
international peacekeeping responsibilities, including keeping a
substantial force under NATO in Afghanistan until withdrawing in
2021; Turkey also has built expeditionary military bases in Qatar,
Somalia, northern Cyprus, and Sudan<br/>
         <br/>
the military has a substantial stake in Turkey's economy through a
