   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Swiss Confederation was founded in 1291 as a defensive
alliance among three cantons. In succeeding years, other localities
joined the original three. The Swiss Confederation secured its
independence from the Holy Roman Empire in 1499. A constitution of
1848, subsequently modified in 1874 to allow voters to introduce
referenda on proposed laws, replaced the confederation with a
centralized federal government. Switzerland's sovereignty and
neutrality have long been honored by the major European powers, and
the country was not involved in either of the two World Wars. The
political and economic integration of Europe over the past half
century, as well as Switzerland's role in many UN and international
organizations, has strengthened Switzerland's ties with its
neighbors. However, the country did not officially become a UN
member until 2002. Switzerland remains active in many UN and
international organizations but retains a strong commitment to
neutrality. </subsection>
