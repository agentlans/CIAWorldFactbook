   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Swiss Confederation was founded in 1291 as a defensive
alliance among three cantons. In succeeding years, other localities
joined the original three. The Swiss Confederation secured its
independence from the Holy Roman Empire in 1499. A constitution of
1848, subsequently modified in 1874 to allow voters to introduce
referenda on proposed laws, replaced the confederation with a
centralized federal government. Switzerland's sovereignty and
neutrality have long been honored by the major European powers, and
the country was not involved in either of the two World Wars. The
political and economic integration of Europe over the past half
century, as well as Switzerland's role in many UN and international
organizations, has strengthened Switzerland's ties with its
neighbors. However, the country did not officially become a UN
member until 2002. Switzerland remains active in many UN and
international organizations but retains a strong commitment to
neutrality. </subsection>

         <br/>
note: in 1863, a newly formed international relief
organization convening in Geneva, Switzerland sought to come up
with an identifying flag or logo; they chose the inverse of the
Swiss flag - a red cross on a white field - as their symbol; today
that organization is known throughout the world as the
International Red Cross</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Switzerland has one of the
highest broadband penetration rates within Europe, with a focus on
services of at least 1Gb/s; this has been supported by sympathetic
regulatory measures as well as by cooperative agreements between
the main telcos, and with local utilities; fast fiber is
complemented by 5G services reaching about 97% of the population by
early 2021; together, these networks will soon enable the telcos to
provide ultra-fast broadband services nationally, ahead of most
other countries in the region; the competitive mobile market is
served by three network operators and a small number of MVNOs; 5G
services offered by the MNOs offer data rates of up to 2Gb/s, and
although various cantons have called a halt to extensions of 5G,
citing health concerns, the regulator and environment ministry have
put in place measures aimed at ensuring that network roll outs can
continue without disruption; with the migration of subscribers to
LTE and 5G networks, the MNOs have been able to begin closing down
their GSM networks and repurpose physical assets and spectrum;
although not a member of the EU, the country’s economic integration
has meant that its telecom market deregulation has followed the
EU’s liberalization framework, including the recent regulations on
international voice roaming; this report presents an analysis of
Switzerland’s fixed-line telecom market, including an assessment of
network infrastructure (2021)<br/>

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
