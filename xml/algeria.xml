   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Algeria has known many empires and dynasties starting with the
ancient Numidians (3rd century B.C.), Phoenicians, Carthaginians,
Romans, Vandals, Byzantines, over a dozen different Arab and Berber
dynasties, Spaniards, and Ottoman Turks. It was under the latter
that the Barbary pirates operated from North Africa and preyed on
shipping beginning in roughly 1500, peaking in the early to
mid-17th century, until finally subdued by the French capture of
Algiers in 1830. The French southward conquest of the entirety of
Algeria proceeded throughout the 19th century and was marked by
many atrocities. The country was heavily colonized by the French in
the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A bloody eight-year
struggle culminated in Algerian independence in 1962.<br/>
         <br/>
Algeria's primary political party, the National Liberation Front
(FLN), was established in 1954 as part of the struggle for
independence and has since largely dominated politics, though it is
falling out of favor with the youth. The Government of Algeria in
1988 instituted a multi-party system in response to public unrest,
but the surprising first round success of the Islamic Salvation
Front (FIS) in the December 1991 legislative elections led the
Algerian army to intervene and postpone the second round of
elections to prevent what the secular elite feared would be an
extremist-led government from assuming power. The army began a
crackdown on the FIS that spurred FIS supporters to begin attacking
government targets. Fighting escalated into an insurgency, which
saw intense violence from 1992-98, resulting in over 100,000 deaths
– many attributed to indiscriminate massacres of villagers by
extremists. The government gained the upper hand by the late-1990s,
and FIS’s armed wing, the Islamic Salvation Army, disbanded in
January 2000. FIS membership is illegal.Former president Abdelaziz BOUTEFLIKA, with the backing of the
military, won the presidency in 1999 in an election that was
boycotted by several candidates protesting alleged fraud, and won
subsequent elections in 2004, 2009, and 2014. Protests broke out
across the country in late February 2019 against President
BOUTEFLIKA’s decision to seek a fifth term. BOUTEFLIKA resigned in
April 2019, and in December 2019, Algerians elected former Prime
Minister Abdelmadjid TEBBOUNE as the country's new president. A
longtime FLN member, TEBBOUNE ran for president as an independent.
In 2020, Algeria held a constitutional referendum, which President
TEBBOUNE enacted in January 2021. Subsequent reforms to the
national electoral law introduced open list voting to curb
corruption. The new law also eliminated gender quotas in
Parliament, and the June 2021 legislative elections saw female
representation plummet. Local elections took place in November
2021. The referendum, parliamentary elections, and local elections
saw record low voter turnout. Since 2014, Algeria’s reliance on
hydrocarbon revenues to fund the government and finance the large
subsidies for the population has fallen under stress because of
declining oil prices.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">For the first two thirds of the 20th century, Algeria's high
fertility rate caused its population to grow rapidly. However,
about a decade after independence from France in 1962, the total
fertility rate fell dramatically from 7 children per woman in the
1970s to about 2.4 in 2000, slowing Algeria's population growth
rate by the late 1980s. The lower fertility rate was mainly the
result of women's rising age at first marriage (virtually all
Algerian children being born in wedlock) and to a lesser extent the
wider use of contraceptives. Later marriages and a preference for
smaller families are attributed to increases in women's education
and participation in the labor market; higher unemployment; and a
shortage of housing forcing multiple generations to live together.
The average woman's age at first marriage increased from about 19
in the mid-1950s to 24 in the mid-1970s to 30.5 in the late
1990s.Algeria's fertility rate experienced an unexpected upturn in the
early 2000s, as the average woman's age at first marriage dropped
slightly. The reversal in fertility could represent a temporary
fluctuation in marriage age or, less likely, a decrease in the
steady rate of contraceptive use.Thousands of Algerian peasants - mainly Berber men from the
Kabylia region - faced with land dispossession and economic
hardship under French rule migrated temporarily to France to work
in manufacturing and mining during the first half of the 20th
century. This movement accelerated during World War I, when
Algerians filled in for French factory workers or served as
soldiers. In the years following independence, low-skilled Algerian
workers and Algerians who had supported the French (known as
Harkis) emigrated en masse to France. Tighter French immigration
rules and Algiers' decision to cease managing labor migration to
France in the 1970s limited legal emigration largely to family
reunification.Not until Algeria's civil war in the 1990s did the country again
experience substantial outmigration. Many Algerians legally entered
Tunisia without visas claiming to be tourists and then stayed as
workers. Other Algerians headed to Europe seeking asylum, although
France imposed restrictions. Sub-Saharan African migrants came to
Algeria after its civil war to work in agriculture and mining. In
the 2000s, a wave of educated Algerians went abroad seeking skilled
jobs in a wider range of destinations, increasing their presence in
North America and Spain. At the same time, legal foreign workers
principally from China and Egypt came to work in Algeria's
construction and oil sectors. Illegal migrants from Sub-Saharan
Africa, particularly Malians, Nigeriens, and Gambians, continue to
come to Algeria in search of work or to use it as a stepping stone
to Libya and Europe.Since 1975, Algeria also has been the main recipient of Sahrawi
refugees from the ongoing conflict in Western Sahara (today part of
Morocco). More than 100,000 Sahrawis are estimated to be living in
five refugee camps in southwestern Algeria near Tindouf.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Algeria has a steadily
developing telecom infrastructure with growth encouraged by
supportive regulatory measures and by government policies aimed at
delivering serviceable internet connections across the country;
mobile broadband is largely based on 3G and LTE, and the data rates
are also low in global terms; LTE is available in all provinces,
investment is required from the mobile network operators (MNOs) to
improve the quality of service; the state has previously been
hesitant to commit to 5G, instead encouraging the MNOs to undertake
upgrades to LTE infrastructure before investing in commercial 5G
services; in March 2022, the state is in the process of freeing up
the requisite spectrum to enable the MNOs to launch 5G services
sometime this year; fixed internet speeds remain slow (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: a limited network of fixed-lines with a
teledensity of slightly less than 12 telephones per 100 persons has
been offset by the rapid increase in mobile-cellular
subscribership; mobile-cellular teledensity was approximately 106
telephones per 100 persons in 2020 (2021)<br/>

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

note: as of 2020, conscripts comprised an

      <subsection title="Military - note">the ANP has played a large role in the country’s politics since
independence in 1962, including coups in 1965 and 1991; it was a
key backer of BOUTEFLIKA’s election in 1999 and remained a center
of power during his 20-year rule; the military was instrumental in
BOUTEFLIKA’s resignation in 2019 when it withdrew support and
called for him to be removed from office<br/>
         <br/>
the ANP traditionally has focused on internal stability and on
Morocco where relations as of 2022 remained tense over Western
Sahara and Algerian accusations that Morocco supports the Movement
for the Autonomy of Kabylie (MAK), a separatist group in Algeria’s
Kabylie region; however, following the Arab Spring events of 2011
and a series of cross-border terrorist attacks emanating from Mali
in 2012-2013, particularly the 2013 attack on a commercial gas
plant by al-Qa’ida-linked terrorists that resulted in the deaths of
35 hostages and 29 jihadists, it has made a concerted effort to
beef up security along its other borders and promote regional
security cooperation; since 2013, additional Army and paramilitary
forces were deployed to the borders with Tunisia, Libya, Niger, and
Mali to interdict and deter cross-border attacks by Islamic
militant groups; in addition, Algeria has provided security
assistance to some neighboring countries, particularly Tunisia, and
conducted joint military/counter-terrorism operations (2022)</subsection>

      <subsection title="Trafficking in persons">tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List — Algeria does
not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of
trafficking but is making significant efforts to do so; the
government made key achievements during the reporting period,
therefore Algeria was upgraded to Tier 2 Watch List; authorities
identified more trafficking victims, increased investigations and
prosecutions, while continuing to convict traffickers; Algeria
partnered with international organizations to train officials and
conduct public awareness campaigns; however, government
identification of and services for victims remained insufficient;
authorities continued to punish some potential victims for unlawful
acts traffickers compelled them to commit (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
trafficking profile:human traffickers exploit domestic and foreign victims; Algerian
women and girls are vulnerable to sex trafficking due to financial
problems or after running away from home; undocumented sub-Saharan
migrants are vulnerable to labor and sex trafficking and are
exploited in restaurants, houses, and informal worksites;
sub-Saharan men and women needing more funds for their onward
journey to Europe work illegally in construction and commercial sex
and are vulnerable to sex trafficking and debt bondage; foreign
women and girls, mainly from sub-Saharan Africa, are subject to sex
trafficking in bars and informal brothels; criminal begging rings
that exploit sub-Saharan African migrant children are common and
reportedly increasing (2022)</subsection>
