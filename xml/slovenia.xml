   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Slovene lands were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until
the latter's dissolution at the end of World War I. In 1918, the
Slovenes joined the Serbs and Croats in forming a new multinational
state, which was named Yugoslavia in 1929. After World War II,
Slovenia was one of the republics in the restored Yugoslavia,
which, though communist, soon distanced itself from the Soviet
Union and spearheaded the Non-Aligned Movement. Dissatisfied with
the exercise of power by the majority Serbs, the Slovenes succeeded
in establishing their independence in 1991 after a short 10-day
war. Historical ties to Western Europe, a growing economy, and a
stable democracy have assisted in Slovenia's postcommunist
transition. Slovenia acceded to both NATO and the EU in the spring
of 2004; it joined the euro zone and the Schengen Area in 2007.</subsection>
