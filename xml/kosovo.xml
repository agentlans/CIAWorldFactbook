   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The central Balkans were part of the Roman and Byzantine Empires
before ethnic Serbs migrated to the territories of modern Kosovo in
the 7th century. During the medieval period, Kosovo became the
center of a Serbian Empire and saw the construction of many
important Serb religious sites, including many architecturally
significant Serbian Orthodox monasteries. The defeat of Serbian
forces at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 led to five centuries of
Ottoman rule during which large numbers of Turks and Albanians
moved to Kosovo. By the end of the 19th century, Albanians replaced
Serbs as the dominant ethnic group in Kosovo. Serbia reacquired
control over the region from the Ottoman Empire during the First
Balkan War of 1912. After World War II, Kosovo's present-day
boundaries were established when Kosovo became an autonomous
province of Serbia in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(S.F.R.Y.). Despite legislative concessions, Albanian nationalism
increased in the 1980s, which led to riots and calls for Kosovo's
independence. The Serbs - many of whom viewed Kosovo as their
cultural heartland - instituted a new constitution in 1989 revoking
Kosovo's autonomous status. Kosovo's Albanian leaders responded in
1991 by organizing a referendum declaring Kosovo independent.
Serbia undertook repressive measures against the Kosovar Albanians
in the 1990s, provoking a Kosovar Albanian insurgency.Beginning in 1998, Serbia conducted a brutal counterinsurgency
campaign that resulted in massacres and massive expulsions of
ethnic Albanians (some 800,000 ethnic Albanians were forced from
their homes in Kosovo). After international attempts to mediate the
conflict failed, a three-month NATO military operation against
Serbia beginning in March 1999 forced the Serbs to agree to
withdraw their military and police forces from Kosovo. UN Security
Council Resolution 1244 (1999) placed Kosovo under a transitional
administration, the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo,
pending a determination of Kosovo's future status. A UN-led process
began in late 2005 to determine Kosovo's final status. The 2006-07
negotiations ended without agreement between Belgrade and Pristina,
though the UN issued a comprehensive report on Kosovo's final
status that endorsed independence. On 17 February 2008, the Kosovo
Assembly declared Kosovo independent. Since then, close to 100
countries have recognized Kosovo, and it has joined numerous
international organizations. In October 2008, Serbia sought an
advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on
the legality under international law of Kosovo's declaration of
independence. The ICJ released the advisory opinion in July 2010
affirming that Kosovo's declaration of independence did not violate
general principles of international law, UN Security Council
Resolution 1244, or the Constitutive Framework. The opinion was
closely tailored to Kosovo's unique history and circumstances.Demonstrating Kosovo’s development into a sovereign,
multi-ethnic, democratic country, the international community ended
the period of Supervised Independence in 2012. Kosovo held its most
recent national and municipal elections in 2021, ushering in a
government led by the Self-Determination Movement's (VV) Albin
KURTI, a former political prisoner who did not fight in the 1998-99
war. Serbia continues to reject Kosovo's independence, but the two
countries agreed in April 2013 to normalize their relations through
EU-facilitated talks, which produced several subsequent agreements
the parties are implementing to varying degrees, though they have
not yet reached a comprehensive normalization of relations. Kosovo
has pursued bilateral recognitions and memberships in international
organizations, moves that Serbia strongly opposes. Kosovo signed a
Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU in 2015, and
the EU named Kosovo as among the six Western Balkan countries that
will be able to join the organization once it meets the criteria to
accede. Kosovo also seeks memberships in the UN and in NATO.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Kosovo has benefited from
financial and regulatory assistance as part of the EU pre-accession
process; the telecom sector has been liberalized, and legislation
has aligned the sector with the EU’s revised regulatory framework;
poor telecom infrastructure has meant that fixed-line communication
remains low by European standards; unlike most markets, the
fixed-line broadband sector is dominated by new players; there is
effective competition between the main cable and DSL operators,
though as yet there is little progress with the expansion of fiber
networks; the mobile sector accounts for most telecom lines for
voice services, as well as the greater part of telecom revenue; two
MNOs dominate the sector (2022 )<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line roughly 6 per 100 and
mobile-cellular 32 per 100 persons (2019)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 383<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
