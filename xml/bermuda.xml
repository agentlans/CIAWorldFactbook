      <subsection title="Background">Bermuda was first settled in 1609 by shipwrecked English
colonists heading for Virginia. Self-governing since 1620, Bermuda
is the oldest and most populous of the British overseas
territories. Vacationing to the island to escape North American
winters first developed in Victorian times. Tourism continues to be
important to the island's economy, although international business
has overtaken it in recent years. Bermuda has also developed into a
highly successful offshore financial center. A referendum on
independence from the UK was soundly defeated in 1995.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: the telecom sector has seen
a decline in subscriber numbers (particularly for prepaid mobile
services the mainstay of short term visitors) and revenue; fixed
and mobile broadband services are two areas that have benefited
from the crisis as employees and students have resorted to working
from home; one area of the telecom market that is not prepared for
growth is 5G mobile; governments, regulators, and even the mobile
network operators have shown that they have not been investing in
5G opportunities at the present time; network expansion and
enhancements remain concentrated around improving LTE coverage

teledensity nearing 40 per 100, coupled with a mobile-cellular

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
