   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Armenia prides itself on being the first nation to formally
adopt Christianity (early 4th century). Despite periods of
autonomy, over the centuries Armenia came under the sway of various
empires including the Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Persian, and Ottoman.
During World War I in the western portion of Armenia, the Ottoman
Empire instituted a policy of forced resettlement coupled with
other harsh practices that resulted in at least 1 million Armenian
deaths - actions widely recognized as constituting genocide. The
eastern area of Armenia was ceded by the Ottomans to Russia in
1828; this portion declared its independence in 1918, but was
conquered by the Soviet Red Army in 1920.Armenia remains involved in the protracted struggle with
Azerbaijan over control of Nagorno-Karabakh, a primarily ethnic
Armenian region that Moscow recognized in 1923 as an autonomous
oblast within Soviet Azerbaijan. In the late Soviet period, a
separatist movement developed that sought to end Azerbaijani
control over the region. Fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh began in
1988 and escalated after Armenia and Azerbaijan attained
independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. By the time a
cease-fire took effect in May 1994, separatists, with Armenian
support, controlled Nagorno‑Karabakh and seven surrounding
Azerbaijani territories. Following the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War
in September-November 2020, Armenia lost control over much of the
territory it had captured a quarter century earlier. Under the
terms of a cease-fire agreement signed in November 2020, Armenia
returned to Azerbaijan the remaining territories it occupied and
some parts of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, including the key city
that Armenians call Shushi and Azerbaijanis call Shusha.Turkey closed the common border with Armenia in 1993 in support
of Azerbaijan in its conflict with Armenia over control of
Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas, further hampering Armenian
economic growth. In 2009, Armenia and Turkey signed Protocols
normalizing relations between the two countries, but neither
country ratified the Protocols, and Armenia officially withdrew
from the Protocols in March 2018. In 2015, Armenia joined the
Eurasian Economic Union alongside Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and
Kyrgyzstan. In November 2017, Armenia signed a Comprehensive and
Enhanced Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with the EU.In spring 2018, former President of Armenia (2008-18) Serzh
SARGSIAN of the Republican Party of Armenia (RPA) tried to extend
his time in power by becoming prime minister, prompting popular
protests that became known as the “Velvet Revolution” after
SARGSIAN was forced to resign. The leader of the protests, Civil
Contract party chief Nikol PASHINYAN, was elected by the National
Assembly as the new prime minister on 8 May 2018. PASHINYAN’s party
prevailed in an early legislative election in December 2018, and he
was reelected as prime minister. </subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Armenia’s population peaked at nearly 3.7 million in the late
1980s but has declined sharply since independence in 1991, to just
over 3 million in 2021, largely as a result of its decreasing
fertility rate, increasing death rate, and negative net emigration
rate.  The total fertility rate (the average number of
children born per woman) first fell below the 2.1 replacement level
in the late 1990s and has hovered around 1.6-1.65 for over 15
years.  In an effort to increase the country’s birth rate, the
government has expanded its child benefits, including a substantial
increase in the lump sum payment for having a first and second
child and a boost in the monthly payment to mothers of children
under two.  Reversing net negative migration, however, remains
the biggest obstacle to stabilizing or increasing population
growth.  Emigration causes Armenia not only lose individuals
but also the children they might have. The emigration of a significant number of working-age people
combined with decreased fertility and increased life expectancy is
causing the elderly share of Armenia’s population to grow. 
The growing elderly population will put increasing pressure on the
government’s ability to fund the pension system, health care, and
other services for seniors.  Improving education, creating
more jobs (particularly in the formal sector), promoting labor
market participation, and increasing productivity would mitigate
the financial impact of supporting a growing elderly
population.Armenia has a long history of migration, some forced and some
voluntary.  Its large diaspora is diverse and dispersed around
the world.  Widely varying estimates suggest the Armenian
diaspora may number anywhere from 5-9 million, easily outnumbering
the number of Armenians living in Armenia.  Armenians forged
communities abroad from ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome to Russia
and to the Americas, where they excelled as craftsmen, merchants,
and in other occupations. Several waves of Armenian migration occurred in the
20th century.  In the aftermath of the 1915
Armenian genocide, hundreds of thousands of survivors fled to
communities in the Caucasus (including present day Armenia),
Lebanon, Syria, Iran, Europe, and Russia and established new
communities in Africa and the Americas.  In the 1930s, the
Soviets deported thousands of Armenians to Siberia and Central
Asia.  After World War II, the Soviets encouraged the Armenian
diaspora in France, the Middle East, and Iran to return the
Armenian homeland in order to encourage population growth after
significant losses in the male workforce during the war. </subsection>

      <subsection title="Military - note">since November 2020, Russia has deployed about 2,000
peacekeeping troops to the area in and around Nagorno-Karabakh as
part of a cease-fire agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan;
fighting erupted between the two countries over the
Nagorno-Karabakh region in September of 2020; Nagorno-Karabakh lies
within Azerbaijan but has been under control of ethnic Armenian
forces (the "Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army") backed by Armenia
since a separatist war there ended in 1994; six weeks of fighting
resulted in about 6,500 deaths and ended after Armenia ceded swaths
of Nagorno-Karabakh territory; tensions remained high into 2023,
and both sides have accused the other of provocations since the
fighting ended; Armenia has accused Azerbaijani forces of a series
of border intrusions and of seizing pockets of
territory 

Armenia has been a member of the Collective Security Treaty
Organization (CSTO) since 1994 and contributes troops to CSTO's
rapid reaction force (2023)</subsection>

Azerbaijani, and Georgian borders

Armenia-Azerbaijan: The dispute over the break-away
Nagorno-Karabakh region and the Armenian military occupation of
surrounding lands in Azerbaijan remains the primary focus of
regional instability. Residents have evacuated the former
Soviet-era small ethnic enclaves in Armenia and Azerbaijan.

Armenia-Georgia: Georgians restrict Armenian access into
Samtse-Javakheti ethnic Armenian areas. Armenia has made no claims
to the region.

Armenia-Iran: None identified

Armenia-Turkey: In 2009, Swiss mediators facilitated an
accord reestablishing diplomatic ties between Armenia and Turkey,
but neither side has ratified the agreement and the rapprochement
effort has faltered, in part due to resistance from Azerbaijan. The
border has been closed since 1993, and no diplomatic relations
established after Armenian independence. In 2022, Turkey and
Armenia have agreed to move forward with efforts to normalize
relations.
Turkish authorities have complained that blasting from quarries in
Armenia might be damaging the ruins of Ani, an ancient city on the
high ridge overlooking the Arpaçay valley on the opposite
shore. </subsection>
