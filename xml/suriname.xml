   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">First explored by the Spaniards in the 16th century and then
settled by the English in the mid-17th century, Suriname became a
Dutch colony in 1667. With the abolition of African slavery in
1863, workers were brought in from India and Java. The Netherlands
granted the colony independence in 1975. Five years later, the
civilian government was replaced by a military regime that soon
declared Suriname a socialist republic. It continued to exert
control through a succession of nominally civilian administrations
until 1987, when international pressure finally forced a democratic
election. In 1990, the military overthrew the civilian leadership,
but a democratically elected government - a four-party coalition -
returned to power in 1991. The coalition expanded to eight parties
in 2005 and ruled until August 2010, when voters returned former
military leader Desire BOUTERSE and his opposition coalition to
power. President BOUTERSE was reelected unopposed in 2015.
Opposition parties campaigned hard against BOUTERSE in the lead up
to the May 2020 elections and, in July 2020, a coalition led by
Chandrikapersad SANTOKHI’s VHP and Ronnie Brunswijk’s ABOP was
installed. The SANTOKHI government promised to tackle COVID-19, the
economic crisis it inherited, and corruption.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Suriname is a pluralistic society consisting primarily of
Creoles (persons of mixed African and European heritage), the
descendants of escaped African slaves known as Maroons, and the
descendants of Indian and Javanese (Indonesian) contract workers.
The country overall is in full, post-industrial demographic
transition, with a low fertility rate, a moderate mortality rate,
and a rising life expectancy. However, the Maroon population of the
rural interior lags behind because of lower educational attainment
and contraceptive use, higher malnutrition, and significantly less
access to electricity, potable water, sanitation, infrastructure,
and health care.Some 350,000 people of Surinamese descent live in the
Netherlands, Suriname's former colonial ruler. In the 19th century,
better-educated, largely Dutch-speaking Surinamese began emigrating
to the Netherlands. World War II interrupted the outflow, but it
resumed after the war when Dutch labor demands grew - emigrants
included all segments of the Creole population. Suriname still is
strongly influenced by the Netherlands because most Surinamese have
relatives living there and it is the largest supplier of
development aid. Other emigration destinations include French
Guiana and the United States. Suriname's immigration rules are
flexible, and the country is easy to enter illegally because
rainforests obscure its borders. Since the mid-1980s, Brazilians
have settled in Suriname's capital, Paramaribo, or eastern
Suriname, where they mine gold. This immigration is likely to
slowly re-orient Suriname toward its Latin American roots.</subsection>
