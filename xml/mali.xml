   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Present-day Mali is named after the Mali Empire that ruled the
region between the 13th and 16th centuries. At its peak in the 14th
century, it was the largest and wealthiest empire in West Africa
and controlled an area about twice the size of modern-day France.
Primarily a trading empire, Mali derived its wealth from gold and
maintained several goldfields and trade routes in the Sahel. The
empire also influenced West African culture through the spread of
its language, laws, and customs, but by the 16th century it
fragmented into mostly small chiefdoms.  The Songhai Empire,
previously a Mali dependency centered in Timbuktu, gained
prominence in the 15th and 16th centuries. Under Songhai rule,
Timbuktu became a large commercial center and well-known for its
scholarship and religious teaching. Timbuktu remains a center of
culture in West Africa today. In the late 16th century, the Songhai
Empire fell to Moroccan invaders and disintegrated into independent
sultanates and kingdoms.France, expanding from Senegal, seized control of the area in
the 1890s and incorporated it into French West Africa as French
Sudan. In 1960, French Sudan gained independence from France and
became the Mali Federation. When Senegal withdrew after only a few
months, the remaining area was renamed the Republic of Mali. Mali
saw 31 years of dictatorship until 1991, when a military coup led
by Amadou Toumani TOURE ousted the government, established a
new constitution, and instituted a multi-party democracy. President
Alpha Oumar KONARE won Mali's first two democratic presidential
elections in 1992 and 1997. In keeping with Mali's two-term
constitutional limit, he stepped down in 2002 and was succeeded by
Amadou Toumani TOURE, who won a second term in 2007.In 2012, rising ethnic tensions and an influx of fighters - some
linked to Al-Qa’ida - from Libya led to a rebellion and military
coup. Following the coup, rebels expelled the military from the
country’s three northern regions, allowing terrorist organizations
to develop strongholds in the area. With French military
intervention, the Malian Government managed to retake most of the
north. However, the government’s grasp in the region remains weak
with local militias, terrorists, and insurgent groups continuously
trying to expand control. In 2015, the Malian Government and
northern rebels signed an internationally mediated peace accord.
Despite a June 2017 target for implementation of the agreement, the
signatories have made little progress. Extremist groups were left
out of the peace process, and terrorist attacks remain common.
 Ibrahim Boubacar KEITA won the Malian presidential elections in
2013 and 2018. Aside from security and logistic shortfalls,
international observers deemed these elections credible. Terrorism,
banditry, ethnic-based violence, and extra-judicial military
killings plagued the country during KEITA’s second term. In August
2020, the military arrested KEITA, his prime minister, and other
senior members of the government and established a military junta
called the National Committee for the Salvation of the People
(CNSP). In September 2020, the junta established a transition
government and appointed Bah N’DAW, a retired army officer and
former defense minister, as interim president and Colonel Assimi
GOITA, the coup leader and chairman of the CNSP, as interim vice
president. The transition government’s charter allowed it to rule
for up to 18 months before calling a general election.  <br/>
         <br/>
In May 2021, Colonel Assimi GOITA led a military takeover,
arresting the interim president after a Cabinet shake up removed
GOITA’s key allies. GOITA was sworn in as transition president in
June 2021 and Choguel Kokalla MAIGA was sworn in as prime minister.
In January 2022, the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) imposed sanctions against the transition government and
member states closed their borders after the transition government
presented a five-year extension to the electoral calendar. ECOWAS
and the transition government continue to work to negotiate an
acceptable electoral calendar.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Mali’s total population is expected to double by 2035; its
capital Bamako is one of the fastest-growing cities in Africa. A
young age structure, a declining mortality rate, and a sustained
high total fertility rate of 5.5 children per woman – the fourth
highest in the world, as of 2022 – ensure continued rapid
population growth for the foreseeable future. Significant
outmigration only marginally tempers this growth. Despite
decreases, Mali’s infant, child, and maternal mortality rates
remain among the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa because of limited
access to and adoption of family planning, early childbearing,
short birth intervals, the prevalence of female genital cutting,
infrequent use of skilled birth attendants, and a lack of emergency
obstetrical and neonatal care.Mali’s high total fertility rate has been virtually unchanged
for decades, as a result of the ongoing preference for large
families, early childbearing, the lack of female education and
empowerment, poverty, and extremely low contraceptive use. Slowing
Mali’s population growth by lowering its birth rate will be
essential for poverty reduction, improving food security, and
developing human capital and the economy.Mali has a long history of seasonal migration and emigration
driven by poverty, conflict, demographic pressure, unemployment,
food insecurity, and droughts. Many Malians from rural areas
migrate during the dry period to nearby villages and towns to do
odd jobs or to adjoining countries to work in agriculture or
mining. Pastoralists and nomads move seasonally to southern Mali or
nearby coastal states. Others migrate long term to Mali’s urban
areas, Cote d’Ivoire, other neighboring countries, and in smaller
numbers to France, Mali’s former colonial ruler. Since the early
1990s, Mali’s role has grown as a transit country for regional
migration flows and illegal migration to Europe. Human smugglers
and traffickers exploit the same regional routes used for moving
contraband drugs, arms, and cigarettes.Between early 2012 and 2013, renewed fighting in northern Mali
between government forces and Tuareg secessionists and their
Islamist allies, a French-led international military intervention,
as well as chronic food shortages, caused the displacement of
hundreds of thousands of Malians. Most of those displaced
domestically sought shelter in urban areas of southern Mali, except
for pastoralist and nomadic groups, who abandoned their traditional
routes, gave away or sold their livestock, and dispersed into the
deserts of northern Mali or crossed into neighboring countries.
Almost all Malians who took refuge abroad (mostly Tuareg and Maure
pastoralists) stayed in the region, largely in Mauritania, Niger,
and Burkina Faso.</subsection>

significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased

note 1: the Gendarmerie and the National Guard are
under the authority of the Ministry of Defense and Veterans Affairs
(Ministere De La Defense Et Des Anciens Combattants, MDAC), but
operational control is shared with the Ministry of Internal
Security and Civil Protection<br/>
         <br/>
note 2: the Gendarmerie's primary mission is
internal security and public order; its duties also include
territorial defense, humanitarian operations, intelligence
gathering, and protecting private property, mainly in rural areas;
it also has a specialized border security unit<br/>
         <br/>
note 3: the National Guard is a military force
responsible for providing security to government facilities and
institutions, prison service, public order, humanitarian
operations, some border security, and intelligence gathering; its
forces include a camel corps for patrolling the deserts and borders
of northern Mali<br/>
         <br/>
note 4: there are also pro-government militias
operating in Mali, such as the Imghad Tuareg Self-Defense Group and
Allies (GATIA); the leader of GATIA is also a general in the

      <subsection title="Military equipment inventories and acquisitions">the FAMA's inventory consists primarily of Soviet-era equipment,

      <subsection title="Military deployments">note: until announcing its withdrawal in May of
2022, Mali was part of a five-nation anti-jihadist task force known
as the G5 Sahel Group, set up in 2014 with Burkina Faso, Chad,
Mauritania, and Niger; Mali had committed 1,100 troops and 200
gendarmes to the force</subsection>
      <subsection title="Military - note">prior to the coup in August 2020 and military takeover in May
2021, the Malian military had intervened in the political arena at
least five times since the country gained independence in 1960; two
attempts failed (1976 and 1978), while three succeeded in
overturning civilian rule (1968, 1991, and 2012)<br/>
         <br/>
the FAMA and the remainder of the security forces collapsed in 2012
during the fighting against Tuareg rebels and Islamic militants and
have since been rebuilt with considerable external assistance,
including the EU, France, and the UN; for example, the EU Training
Mission in Mali (EUTM) from 2013-2022 trained some 14,000 Malian
soldiers and 8 combined arms battalions/battlegroups (Groupement
Tactique InterArmes, GTIA), each of which was structured to be
self-sufficient with its own motorized/mechanized infantry, light
armor, commandos, artillery, engineers, and other support forces;
EUTM suspended its training program in 2022, citing issues with the
ruling military government, including human rights abuses and the
presence of Russian private military contractors; over the same
period, the French military provided assistance to the Malian
security forces and conducted counterterrorism and
counterinsurgency operations in Mali; the French suspended
operations in 2021 and in August 2022 withdrew the last of its
forces while also citing issues with the military government; the
UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali
(MINUSMA) has operated in the country since 2013 with the mission
of providing security, rebuilding Malian security forces,
protecting civilians, supporting national political dialogue, and
assisting in the reestablishment of Malian government authority; as
of late 2022, MINUSMA had around 14,000 personnel
deployed <br/>
         <br/>
the military government has increased security ties with Russia;
Russia has provided military equipment, and in December 2021, Mali
contracted with a Russian private military company to provide
training for local armed forces and security to senior Malian
officials; they have also participated in security operations and
been accused of war crimes; as of 2022, there were an estimated
1,000 Russian military contractors in Mali<br/>
         <br/>
Malian security forces are actively engaged in operations against
several insurgent terrorist groups affiliated with al-Qa'ida and
the Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS), as well as other
rebel groups, communal militias, and criminal bands spread across
the central, northern, and southern regions of the country; the
government was reportedly in control of only an estimated 10-20% of
the country's central and northern territories, and terror attacks
were increasing in the more heavily populated south, including
around the capital Bamako; the Macina Liberation Front (FLM), part
of the Jama’at Nusrat al Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM) coalition of
al-Qa'ida-linked terror groups, has played a large role in a surge
in violence in Mali’s central and southern regions; in the north,
the Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham in the Greater Sahara
(ISIS-GS) has been able to reassert itself in 2022 (2022)</subsection>

      <subsection title="Trafficking in persons">tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List — Mali does not
fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking
but is making significant efforts to do so; government efforts
included prosecuting hereditary slavery cases, increasing
convictions, continuing training and awareness raising activities,
releasing all children associated with the Malian armed forces
(FAMa) to an international organization for care, training law
enforcement officials on protection of children in armed conflict,
identifying 215 children used by armed groups and referring them to
international organizations for care; however, the government did
not stop all use of children in the FAMa; the government continued
to provide support to and collaborate with the Imghad Tuareg and
the Allies Self-Defense Group, which recruited and used child
soldiers; authorities did not investigate any suspects for child
soldier offenses or make efforts to prevent it; law enforcement
lacked resources and training about human trafficking; services for
victims remained insufficient; therefore, Mali was downgraded to
Tier 2 Watch List (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
trafficking profile: Mali is a source, transit,
and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to
forced labor and sex trafficking; women and girls are forced into
domestic servitude, agricultural labor, and support roles in gold
mines, as well as subjected to sex trafficking; Malian boys are
found in conditions of forced labor in agricultural settings, gold
mines, and the informal commercial sector, as well as forced
begging in Mali and neighboring countries; Malians and other
Africans who travel through Mali to Mauritania, Algeria, or Libya
in hopes of reaching Europe are particularly at risk of becoming
victims of human trafficking; men and boys, primarily of Songhai
ethnicity, are subjected to debt bondage in the salt mines of
Taoudenni in northern Mali; some members of Mali's Tuareg community
are subjected to traditional slavery-related practices, and this
involuntary servitude reportedly has extended to their children;
reports indicate that non-governmental armed groups operating in
northern Mali recruited children as combatants, cooks, porters,
guards, spies, and sex slaves; slaveholders use some members of the
Tuareg community in hereditary servitude where communities rather
than individuals or families exploit the enslaved</subsection>
