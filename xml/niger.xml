   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Present-day Niger originated from the nomadic peoples of the
Saharan north and the agriculturalists of the south. The Taureg
kingdom of Takedda was one of the largest kingdoms in the north and
played a prominent role in regional trade in the 14th
century. In the south, the primary ethnic groups were the
Songhai-Zarma in the west, the Hausa in the center, and the Kanuri
in the east. When European colonizers arrived in the
19th century, the region was an assemblage of disparate
local kingdoms.In the late 19th century, the British and French agreed to
partition the middle regions of the Niger River, and France began
its conquest of what would become the colony of Niger.  France
experienced determined local resistance - particularly during the
Tuareg uprising (1916-1917) - but established a colonial
administration in 1922.After achieving independence from France in 1960, Niger
experienced single-party or military rule until 1991 when political
pressure forced General Ali SAIBOU to allow multiparty elections.
Political infighting and democratic backsliding led to coups in
1996 and 1999. In December of that year, military officers restored
democratic rule and held elections that brought Mamadou TANDJA to
power. TANDJA was reelected in 2004 and spearheaded a 2009
constitutional amendment allowing him to extend his presidential
term. In February 2010, military officers led another coup that
deposed TANDJA. ISSOUFOU Mahamadou was elected in April 2011 and
reelected in early 2016. In February 2021, BAZOUM Mohammed won the
presidential election, marking Niger’s first transition from one
democratically elected president to another.

Niger is one of the poorest countries in the world with minimal
government services and insufficient funds to develop its resource
base. It is ranked last in the world on the UN Development
Programme's Human Development Index. The largely agrarian and
subsistence-based economy is frequently disrupted by extended
droughts common to the Sahel region of Africa. The Nigerien
Government continues its attempts to diversify the economy through
increased oil production and mining projects. In addition, Niger is
facing increased security concerns on its borders from various
external threats including insecurity in Libya, spillover from the
conflict and terrorism in Mali, and violent extremism in
northeastern Nigeria.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Niger has the highest total fertility rate (TFR) of any country
in the world, averaging close to 7 children per woman in 2022. A
slight decline in fertility over the last few decades has stalled.
This leveling off of the high fertility rate is in large part a
product of the continued desire for large families. In Niger, the
TFR is lower than the desired fertility rate, which makes it
unlikely that contraceptive use will increase. The high TFR
sustains rapid population growth and a large youth population –
almost 70% of the populace is under the age of 25, as of 2020.
Gender inequality, including a lack of educational opportunities
for women and early marriage and childbirth, also contributes to
high population growth.Because of large family sizes, children are inheriting smaller
and smaller parcels of land. The dependence of most Nigeriens on
subsistence farming on increasingly small landholdings, coupled
with declining rainfall and the resultant shrinkage of arable land,
are all preventing food production from keeping up with population
growth.For more than half a century, Niger's lack of economic
development has led to steady net outmigration. In the 1960s,
Nigeriens mainly migrated to coastal West African countries to work
on a seasonal basis. Some headed to Libya and Algeria in the 1970s
to work in the booming oil industry until its decline in the 1980s.
Since the 1990s, the principal destinations for Nigerien labor
migrants have been West African countries, especially Burkina Faso
and Cote d’Ivoire, while emigration to Europe and North America has
remained modest. During the same period, Niger’s desert trade route
town Agadez became a hub for West African and other Sub-Saharan
migrants crossing the Sahara to North Africa and sometimes onward
to Europe.More than 60,000 Malian refugees have fled to Niger since
violence between Malian government troops and armed rebels began in
early 2012. Ongoing attacks by the Boko Haram Islamist insurgency,
dating to 2013 in northern Nigeria and February 2015 in
southeastern Niger, pushed tens of thousands of Nigerian refugees
and Nigerien returnees across the border to Niger and displaced
thousands of locals in Niger’s already impoverished Diffa
region.</subsection>
