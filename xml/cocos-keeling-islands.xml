   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">British captain William KEELING discovered Cocos (Keeling)
Islands in 1609, and they were named the Cocos Islands in 1622 for
their coconut trees. Some maps began referring to them as the
Keeling Islands in 1703. In 1825, Scottish trader John CLUNIES-ROSS
was trying to get to Christmas Island but was blown off-course and
landed on Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The next year, a British trader
hired John’s brother to bring slaves and a harem of Malay women to
create the first permanent settlement on the island. By the 1830s,
the Clunies-Ross family had firmly established themselves as the
leaders of the islands and they ruled Cocos (Keeling) Islands in a
feudal style until 1978.

The UK annexed the islands in 1857 and administered them from
Ceylon after 1878 and from Singapore after 1886. Cocos (Keeling)
Islands hosted a cable relaying station and was attacked by the
Germans in World War I. The Japanese similarly attacked the islands
in World War II. The UK transferred the islands to Australia in
1955, which officially named the islands the Cocos (Keeling)
Islands, and in 1978, Australia bought all the land held by the
Clunies-Ross family, ending their control of the islands’
governance. In a referendum in 1984, most islanders voted to
integrate with Australia, and Western Australian laws have applied
on the islands since 1992. </subsection>
