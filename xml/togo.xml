   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">From the 11th to the 16th centuries, various ethnic groups
settled the Togo region. From the 16th to the 18th centuries, the
coastal region became a major trading center for enslaved people,
and the surrounding region  took on the name of "The Slave
Coast." In 1884, Germany declared a region including present-day
Togo as a protectorate called Togoland. After World War I, rule
over Togo was transferred to France. French Togoland became Togo
upon independence in 1960. Gen. Gnassingbe EYADEMA, installed as
military ruler in 1967, ruled Togo with a heavy hand for almost
four decades. Despite the facade of multi-party elections
instituted in the early 1990s, the government was largely dominated
by President EYADEMA, whose Rally of the Togolese People (RPT)
party has been in power almost continually since 1967 and its
successor, the Union for the Republic, maintains a majority of
seats in today's legislature. Upon EYADEMA's death in February
2005, the military installed the president's son, Faure GNASSINGBE,
and then engineered his formal election two months later. Togo held
its first relatively free and fair legislative elections in October
2007. Since then, President GNASSINGBE has started the country
along a gradual path to democratic reform. Togo has held multiple
presidential and legislative elections, and in 2019 held its first
local elections in 32 years. Despite those positive moves,
political reconciliation has moved slowly, and the country
experiences periodic outbursts of protests by frustrated citizens
that have led to violence between security forces and protesters.
Constitutional changes in 2019 to institute a runoff system in
presidential elections and to establish term limits has done little
to reduce the resentment many Togolese feel after more than 50
years of one-family rule. GNASSINGBE became eligible for his
current fourth term and one additional fifth term under the new
rules. The next presidential election will be in 2025.  </subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Togo’s population is estimated to have grown to four times its
size between 1960 and 2010. With nearly 60% of its populace under
the age of 25 and a high annual growth rate attributed largely to
high fertility, Togo’s population is likely to continue to expand
for the foreseeable future. Reducing fertility, boosting job
creation, and improving education will be essential to reducing the
country’s high poverty rate. In 2008, Togo eliminated primary
school enrollment fees, leading to higher enrollment but increased
pressure on limited classroom space, teachers, and materials. Togo
has a good chance of achieving universal primary education, but
educational quality, the underrepresentation of girls, and the low
rate of enrollment in secondary and tertiary schools remain
concerns.Togo is both a country of emigration and asylum. In the early
1990s, southern Togo suffered from the economic decline of the
phosphate sector and ethnic and political repression at the hands
of dictator Gnassingbe EYADEMA and his northern, Kabye-dominated
administration. The turmoil led 300,000 to 350,000 predominantly
southern Togolese to flee to Benin and Ghana, with most not
returning home until relative stability was restored in 1997. In
2005, another outflow of 40,000 Togolese to Benin and Ghana
occurred when violence broke out between the opposition and
security forces over the disputed election of EYADEMA’s son Faure
GNASSINGBE to the presidency. About half of the refugees
reluctantly returned home in 2006, many still fearing for their
safety. Despite ethnic tensions and periods of political unrest,
Togo in December 2022 was home to almost 8,400 refugees from
Ghana.</subsection>

in June 2022, the Togolese Government declared a state of emergency
in its northern border region due to the threat from Jama'at Nasr
al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM), a coalition of al-Qa'ida-affiliated
militant groups based in Mali that also operates in neighboring
Burkina Faso; the declaration followed an attack on a Togolese
military post in May that killed 8 soldiers and a Togolese military
operation launched the same month to boost border security and
prevent terrorist infiltrations (2022)</subsection>
      <subsection title="Maritime threats">the International Maritime Bureau reports the territorial and
offshore waters in the Niger Delta and Gulf of Guinea remain a very
high risk for piracy and armed robbery of ships; in 2021, there
were 34 reported incidents of piracy and armed robbery at sea in
the Gulf of Guinea region; although a significant decrease from the
total number of 81 incidents in 2020, it included the one hijacking
and three of five ships fired upon worldwide; while boarding and
attempted boarding to steal valuables from ships and crews are the
most common types of incidents, almost a third of all incidents
involve a hijacking and/or kidnapping; in 2021, 57 crew members
were kidnapped in seven separate incidents in the Gulf of Guinea,
representing 100% of kidnappings worldwide; Nigerian pirates in
particular are well armed and very aggressive, operating as far as
200 nm offshore; the Maritime Administration of the US Department
of Transportation has issued a Maritime Advisory (2022-001 - Gulf
of Guinea-Piracy/Armed Robbery/Kidnapping for Ransom) effective 4
January 2022, which states in part, "Piracy, armed robbery, and
kidnapping for ransom continue to serve as significant threats to
US-flagged vessels transiting or operating in the Gulf of
Guinea"</subsection>
