   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Originally a Dutch colony in the 17th century, by 1815 Guyana
had become a British possession. The abolition of slavery led to
settlement of urban areas by former slaves and the importation of
indentured servants from India to work the sugar plantations. The
resulting ethnocultural divide has persisted and has led to
turbulent politics. Guyana achieved independence from the UK in
1966, and since then it has been ruled mostly by socialist-oriented
governments. In 1992, Cheddi JAGAN was elected president in what is
considered the country's first free and fair election since
independence. After his death five years later, his wife, Janet
JAGAN, became president but resigned in 1999 due to poor health.
Her successor, Bharrat JAGDEO, was elected in 2001 and again in
2006. Early elections held in May 2015 resulted in the first change
in governing party and the replacement of President Donald RAMOTAR
by current President David GRANGER. After a December 2018
no-confidence vote against the GRANGER government, national
elections were constitutionally required to take place within three
months. After over a year of extra-constitutional rule by the
GRANGER administration, elections were held, though voting
irregularities led to a nationwide recount. The current Irfaan ALI
administration was sworn in to office in August 2020. The discovery
of oil in 2015 has been the primary economic and political focus,
with many hoping the significant reserves will transform one of the
poorest countries in the region.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Guyana is the only English-speaking country in South America and
shares cultural and historical bonds with the Anglophone Caribbean.
Guyana's two largest ethnic groups are the Afro-Guyanese
(descendants of African slaves) and the Indo-Guyanese (descendants
of Indian indentured laborers), which together comprise about three
quarters of Guyana's population. Tensions periodically have boiled
over between the two groups, which back ethnically based political
parties and vote along ethnic lines. Poverty reduction has
stagnated since the late 1990s. About one-third of the Guyanese
population lives below the poverty line; indigenous people are
disproportionately affected. Although Guyana's literacy rate is
reported to be among the highest in the Western Hemisphere, the
level of functional literacy is considerably lower, which has been
attributed to poor education quality, teacher training, and
infrastructure.Guyana's emigration rate is among the highest in the world -
more than 55% of its citizens reside abroad - and it is one of the
largest recipients of remittances relative to GDP among Latin
American and Caribbean counties. Although remittances are a vital
source of income for most citizens, the pervasive emigration of
skilled workers deprives Guyana of professionals in healthcare and
other key sectors. More than 80% of Guyanese nationals with
tertiary level educations have emigrated. Brain drain and the
concentration of limited medical resources in Georgetown hamper
Guyana's ability to meet the health needs of its predominantly
rural population. Guyana has one of the highest HIV prevalence
rates in the region and continues to rely on international support
for its HIV treatment and prevention programs.</subsection>

and legal challenges, the 2016 Telecommunications Act was brought
into force in October 2020 by the newly elected government of the
People’s Party Progressive (PPP); the Telecommunications Act sets
out a framework for enabling competition across all segments of the
telecommunications sector in Guyana; the mobile market has been
open to competition since 2001; the Telecommunications Act presents
the country with the potential to benefit from a more level playing
field that may attract new players, but nevertheless Guyana’s
relatively small size and low GDP may restrict it from reaching its
full potential for some more years to come (2021)<br/>

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
