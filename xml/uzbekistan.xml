   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Uzbekistan is the geographic and population center of Central
Asia. The country has a diverse economy and a relatively young
population. Russia conquered and united the disparate territories
of present-day Uzbekistan in the late 19th century. Stiff
resistance to the Red Army after the Bolshevik Revolution was
eventually suppressed and a socialist republic established in 1924.
During the Soviet era, intensive production of "white gold"
(cotton) and grain led to the overuse of agrochemicals and the
depletion of water supplies, leaving the land degraded and the Aral
Sea and certain rivers half-dry. Independent since the dissolution
of the USSR in 1991, the country has diversified agricultural
production while developing its mineral and petroleum export
capacity and increasing its manufacturing base, although cotton
remains a major part of its economy. Uzbekistan’s first president,
Islom KARIMOV, led Uzbekistan for 25 years until his death in
September 2016. His successor, former Prime Minister Shavkat
MIRZIYOYEV, has improved relations with Uzbekistan’s neighbors and
introduced wide-ranging economic, judicial, and social reforms.
MIRZIYOYEV was reelected in October 2021 with 80% of the vote.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Uzbekistan’s telecom
markets both wireline and wireless have been playing "catch up" in
terms of their development following the country's independence
from the former Soviet Union; the government has formally adopted
the principles of operating as a market economy, many elements of
the old centrally planned economic model remain; this has had the
effect of reducing the level of interest from foreign companies and
investors in building out the necessary underlying infrastructure,
which in turn has constrained the rate of growth in the country’s
telecoms sector; the last five years has seen an upswing in
prospects for the sector as fiber network roll outs continue beyond
the main urban centers, while the mobile market experiences some
consolidation for stronger, more efficient competitors; growth is
present in the fixed broadband segment with penetration projected
to reach 24% by 2027 (a 5-year CAGR of 6.2%); despite the promising
signs in the fixed markets, it is the mobile segment that continues
to dominate Uzbekistan’s telecoms sector in terms of penetration,
revenue, and growth;  there are four major operators providing
a modicum of competition; three of the four are government owned
entities; the mobile market is expected to reach 100% penetration
in 2023 a 50% increase in the last five years (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line nearly 10 per 100 persons and
mobile-cellular teledensity nearly 103 per 100 persons; the
state-owned telecommunications company, Uzbek Telecom, owner of the
fixed-line telecommunications system, has used loans from the
Japanese government and the China Development Bank to upgrade
fixed-line services including conversion to digital exchanges;
mobile-cellular services are provided by 2 private and 3
state-owned operators with a total subscriber base of 22.8 million
as of January 2018 (2021)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 998; linked by
fiber-optic cable or microwave radio relay with CIS member states
and to other countries by leased connection via the Moscow
international gateway switch; the country also has a link to the
Trans-Asia-Europe (TAE) fiber-optic cable; Uzbekistan has supported
the national fiber-optic backbone project of Afghanistan since
2008<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
