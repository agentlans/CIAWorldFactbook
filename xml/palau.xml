   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Humans arrived in the Palauan archipelago around 1000 B.C. from
Southeast Asia and developed a complex, highly organized
matrilineal society where high-ranking women picked the chiefs. The
islands were the westernmost part of the widely scattered Pacific
islands north of New Guinea that Spanish explorers named the
Caroline Islands in the 17th century. There were several failed
attempts by Spanish Jesuit missionaries to visit the islands in the
early 1700s. Spain gained some influence in the islands and
administered it from the Philippines but sold Palau to Germany in
1899 after it lost the Philippines in the Spanish-American
War.

Japan seized Palau in 1914, was granted a League of Nations mandate
to administer the islands in 1920, and made Koror the capital of
its South Seas Mandate in 1922. By the outbreak of World War II,
there were four times as many Japanese living in Koror as Palauans.
In 1944, the Battle of Peleliu between US and Japanese forces
resulted in more than 15,000 deaths. Following the war, Palau
became part of the US-administered Trust Territory of the Pacific
Islands.

Palau voted against joining the Federated States of Micronesia in
1978 and adopted its own constitution in 1981, which stated that
Palau was a nuclear-free country. In 1982, Palau signed a Compact
of Free Association (COFA) with the US, which granted Palau
financial assistance and access to many US domestic programs in
exchange for exclusive US military access and defense
responsibilities. However, many Palauans saw the COFA as
incompatible with the Palauan Constitution because of the US
military’s nuclear arsenal, and seven referenda failed to achieve
ratification. Following a constitutional amendment and eighth
referendum in 1993, the COFA was ratified and entered into force in
1994 when the islands gained their independence. Its funding was
renewed in 2010.

Palau has been on the frontlines of combatting climate change and
protecting marine resources. In 2011, Palau banned commercial shark
fishing and created the world’s first shark sanctuary. In 2017,
Palau began stamping the Palau Pledge into passports, reminding
visitors to act in ecologically and culturally responsible ways. In
2020, Palau banned coral reef-toxic sunscreens and expanded its
fishing prohibition to include 80% of its exclusive economic
zone.</subsection>
