   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Following more than three centuries under Portuguese rule,
Brazil gained its independence in 1822, maintaining a monarchical
system of government until the abolition of slavery in 1888 and the
subsequent proclamation of a republic by the military in 1889.
Brazilian coffee exporters politically dominated the country until
populist leader Getúlio VARGAS rose to power in 1930. VARGAS
governed over various versions of democratic and authoritarian
regimes from 1930 to 1945. Democratic rule returned (including a
democratically elected VARGAS administration from 1951 to 1955) and
lasted until 1964, when the military overthrew President João
GOULART. The military regime censored journalists and repressed and
tortured dissidents in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The
dictatorship lasted until 1985, when the military regime peacefully
ceded power to civilian rulers, and the Brazilian Congress passed
its current constitution in 1989. <br/>
         <br/>
By far the largest and most populous country in South America,
Brazil continues to pursue industrial and agricultural growth and
development of its interior. Having successfully weathered a period
of global financial difficulty in the late 20th century, under
President Luiz Inácio LULA da Silva (2003-2010) Brazil was seen as
one of the world's strongest emerging markets and a contributor to
global growth. The awarding of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2016
Summer Olympic Games, the first ever to be held in South America,
was symbolic of the country's rise. However, from about 2013 to
2016, Brazil was plagued by a sagging economy, high unemployment,
and high inflation, only emerging from recession in 2017. Former
President Dilma ROUSSEFF (2011-2016) was removed from office in
2016 by Congress for having committed impeachable acts against
Brazil's budgetary laws, and her vice president, Michel TEMER,
served the remainder of her second term. A money-laundering
investigation, Operation Lava Jato, uncovered a vast corruption
scheme and prosecutors charged several high-profile Brazilian
politicians with crimes. Former-President LULA was convicted of
accepting bribes and served jail time (2018-19), although his
conviction was overturned in early 2021. LULA's revival became
complete in October 2022 when he narrowly defeated incumbent Jair
BOLSONARO (2019-2022) in the presidential election.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Brazil's rapid fertility decline since the 1960s is the main
factor behind the country's slowing population growth rate, aging
population, and fast-paced demographic transition. Brasilia has not
taken full advantage of its large working-age population to develop
its human capital and strengthen its social and economic
institutions but is funding a study abroad program to bring
advanced skills back to the country. The current favorable age
structure will begin to shift around 2025, with the labor force
shrinking and the elderly starting to compose an increasing share
of the total population. Well-funded public pensions have nearly
wiped out poverty among the elderly, and Bolsa Familia and other
social programs have lifted tens of millions out of poverty. More
than half of Brazil's population is considered middle class, but
poverty and income inequality levels remain high; the Northeast,
North, and Center-West, women, and black, mixed race, and
indigenous populations are disproportionately affected. Disparities
in opportunities foster social exclusion and contribute to Brazil's
high crime rate, particularly violent crime in cities and favelas
(slums).Brazil has traditionally been a net recipient of immigrants,
with its southeast being the prime destination. After the
importation of African slaves was outlawed in the mid-19th century,
Brazil sought Europeans (Italians, Portuguese, Spaniards, and
Germans) and later Asians (Japanese) to work in agriculture,
especially coffee cultivation. Recent immigrants come mainly from
Argentina, Chile, and Andean countries (many are unskilled illegal
migrants) or are returning Brazilian nationals. Since Brazil's
economic downturn in the 1980s, emigration to the United States,
Europe, and Japan has been rising but is negligible relative to
Brazil's total population. The majority of these emigrants are
well-educated and middle-class. Fewer Brazilian peasants are
emigrating to neighboring countries to take up agricultural
work.</subsection>

celestial globe with 27 white five-pointed stars; the globe has a
white equatorial band with the motto ORDEM E PROGRESSO (Order and
Progress); the current flag was inspired by the banner of the
former Empire of Brazil (1822-1889); on the imperial flag, the
green represented the House of Braganza of Pedro I, the first
Emperor of Brazil, while the yellow stood for the Habsburg Family
of his wife; on the modern flag the green represents the forests of
the country and the yellow rhombus its mineral wealth (the diamond
shape roughly mirrors that of the country); the blue circle and
stars, which replaced the coat of arms of the original flag, depict
the sky over Rio de Janeiro on the morning of 15 November 1889 -
the day the Republic of Brazil was declared; the number of stars
has changed with the creation of new states and has risen from an
original 21 to the current 27 (one for each state and the Federal
District)<br/>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Brazil is one of the
largest mobile and broadband markets in Latin America with healthy
competition and pricing; the development of 5G, was scheduled for
March 2020 but was delayed due to interference issues with
satellite TV broadcasts and the pandemic; the auction was completed
November 2021; the licenses are obliged to provide 5G services to
all capital cities by July 2022, as well as about 35,500km of the
national highway network; the country also has one of the largest
fixed line broadband markets in Latin America, though broadband
subscriptions is only slightly above the regional average, trailing
behind Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay; amendments to the licensing
regime adopted in October 2019 also require that ISPs which have
switched to authorizations invest money saved from lighter
regulations in the expansion of broadband services; the fixed line
broadband market has seen rapid growth for a number of years, with
a growing focus on fiber broadband; in 2019 the number of fiber
accesses overtook DSL connections; the country is a key landing
point for a number of important submarine cables connecting to the
US, Central and South America, the Caribbean, Europe, and Africa;
several new cable systems are due to come into service through to
2022, which will increase bandwidth and push down broadband prices
for end-users; investments have also been made into terrestrial
fiber cables between Brazil, Argentina, and Chile (2021)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line connections stand at roughly
14 per 100 persons; less-expensive mobile-cellular technology has
been a major impetus broadening telephone service to the
lower-income segments of the population with mobile-cellular
teledensity roughly 97 per 100 persons (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 55; landing points
for a number of submarine cables, including Malbec, ARBR, Tamnat,
SAC, SAm-1, Atlantis -2, Seabras-1, Monet, EllaLink, BRUSA,
GlobeNet, AMX-1, Brazilian Festoon, Bicentenario, Unisur, Junior,
Americas -II, SAE x1, SAIL, SACS and SABR that
provide direct connectivity to South and Central America, the
Caribbean, the US, Africa, and Europe; satellite earth
stations - 3 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean), 1 Inmarsat (Atlantic Ocean
region east), connected by microwave relay system to Mercosur
Brazilsat B3 satellite earth station; satellites is
a major communication platform, as it is almost impossible to
lay fiber optic cable in the thick vegetation (2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
