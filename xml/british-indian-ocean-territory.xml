   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Formerly administered as part of the British Crown Colony of
Mauritius, the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) was
established as an overseas territory of the UK in 1965. A number of
the islands of the territory were later transferred to the
Seychelles when it attained independence in 1976. Subsequently,
BIOT has consisted only of the six main island groups comprising
the Chagos Archipelago. Only Diego Garcia, the largest and most
southerly of the islands, is inhabited. It contains a joint UK-US
naval support facility and hosts one of four dedicated ground
antennas that assist in the operation of the Global Positioning
System (GPS) navigation system (the others are on Kwajalein
(Marshall Islands), at Cape Canaveral, Florida (US), and on
Ascension Island (Saint Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha)).
The US Air Force also operates a telescope array on Diego Garcia as
part of the Ground-Based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance
System (GEODSS) for tracking orbital debris, which can be a hazard
to spacecraft and astronauts.Between 1967 and 1973, former agricultural workers, earlier
residents in the islands, were relocated primarily to Mauritius,
but also to the Seychelles. Negotiations between 1971 and 1982
resulted in the establishment of a trust fund by the British
Government as compensation for the displaced islanders, known as
Chagossians. Beginning in 1998, the islanders pursued a series of
lawsuits against the British Government seeking further
compensation and the right to return to the territory. In 2006 and
2007, British court rulings invalidated the immigration policies
contained in the 2004 BIOT Constitution Order that had excluded the
islanders from the archipelago, but upheld the special military
status of Diego Garcia. In 2008, the House of Lords, as the final
court of appeal in the UK, ruled in favor of the British Government
by overturning the lower court rulings and finding no right of
return for the Chagossians. In March 2015, the Permanent Court of
Arbitration unanimously held that the marine protected area that
the UK declared around the Chagos Archipelago in April 2010 was in
violation of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.<br/>
         <br/>
In February 2019, the International Court of Justice ruled in an
advisory opinion that Britain’s decolonization of Mauritius was not
completed lawfully because of continued Chagossian claims. A
non-binding May 2019 UN General Assembly vote demanded that Britain
end its “colonial administration” of the Chagos Archipelago and
that it be returned to Mauritius. UK officials defend Britain's
sovereignty over the islands and argue that the issue is a
bilateral dispute between Mauritius and the UK that does not
warrant international intervention. <br/>
