   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Indigenous groups inhabited central and southern Chile for
several thousands of years, living in mixed pastoralist and settled
communities, ending with the Inca ruling the north of the country
for nearly a century prior to the arrival of the Spanish in the
16th century. The Captaincy General of Chile was founded by the
Spanish in 1541, lasting until Chile declared its independence in
1810. The subsequent struggle became tied to other South American
independence conflicts, with a decisive victory over the Spanish
not being achieved until 1818. In the War of the Pacific (1879-83),
Chile defeated Peru and Bolivia to win its current northernmost
regions. By the 1880s, the Chilean central government cemented its
control over the central and southern regions inhabited by Mapuche
Indigenous peoples. Between 1891 and 1973, a series of elected
governments succeeded each other until the three-year-old Marxist
government of Salvador ALLENDE was overthrown in 1973 by a military
coup led by General Augusto PINOCHET, who ruled until a
democratically elected president was inaugurated in 1990. Economic
reforms, maintained consistently since the 1980s, contributed to
steady growth, reduced poverty rates by over half, and helped
secure the country's commitment to democratic and representative
government. Chile has increasingly assumed regional and
international leadership roles befitting its status as a stable,
democratic nation.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Chile is in the advanced stages of demographic transition and is
becoming an aging society - with fertility below replacement level,
low mortality rates, and life expectancy on par with developed
countries. Nevertheless, with its dependency ratio nearing its low
point, Chile could benefit from its favorable age structure. It
will need to keep its large working-age population productively
employed, while preparing to provide for the needs of its growing
proportion of elderly people, especially as women - the traditional
caregivers - increasingly enter the workforce. Over the last two
decades, Chile has made great strides in reducing its poverty rate,
which is now lower than most Latin American countries. However, its
severe income inequality ranks as the worst among members of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Unequal
access to quality education perpetuates this uneven income
distribution.Chile has historically been a country of emigration but has
slowly become more attractive to immigrants since transitioning to
democracy in 1990 and improving its economic stability (other
regional destinations have concurrently experienced deteriorating
economic and political conditions). Most of Chile's small but
growing foreign-born population consists of transplants from other
Latin American countries, especially Peru.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">the market for fixed and mobile telephony is highly competitive and rapidly evolving; the mobile rate is among the highest in South America; LTE infrastructure is extensive and 5G spectrum auctions which took place in February 2021 are expected to prompt the deployment of 5G networks by the end of the year, following extensive trials held by the MNOs; fixed broadband is relatively high for the region, with services among the fastest and least expensive in Latin America; government initiatives such as the National Fiber Optic project and Fibra Óptica Austral are providing high-capacity connectivity across the country and will further increase fixed-line broadband; there is a strong focus on fiber broadband, with the number of fiber subscribers having increased 61.7% in 2020, year-on-year; technological improvements have allowed operators to provide a variety of services via their networks, giving rise to a number of bundled packages at competitive prices, including access to video on demand services which in turn is increasing fixed-line broadband; traditional fixed-line teledensity continues to fall as consumers switch to mobile networks and to fixed broadband for voice and data connectivity; more than 8,300 schools receive free broadband as part of the ‘Connectivity for Education 2030’ project (2021)</note>
         <note title="domestic">number of fixed-line connections have dropped to about 13 per 100 in recent years as mobile-cellular usage continues to increase, reaching 131 telephones per 100 persons; domestic satellite system with 3 earth stations (2020)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>

      <subsection title="Military - note">the Chilean Army was founded in 1810, but traces its origins
back to the Army of the Kingdom of Chile, which was established by
the Spanish Crown in the early 1600s; the Navy traces its origins
to 1817; it was first led by a British officer and its first ships
were largely crewed by American, British, and Irish sailors; by the
1880s, the Chilean Navy was one of the most powerful in the
Americas, and included the world’s first protected cruiser (a ship
with an armored deck to protect vital machine spaces); Chile's
military aviation was inaugurated in 1913 with the creation of a
military aviation school

Chile and Argentina have a joint peacekeeping force known as the
Combined Southern Cross Peacekeeping Force (FPC), designed to be
made available to the UN; the FPC is made up of two battalions, one

to an equidistance line with a southwestern axis favoring Peru; in
October 2007, Peru took its maritime complaint with Chile to the
ICJ; territorial claim in Antarctica (Chilean Antarctic Territory)
