   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The first humans settled in New Caledonia around 1600 B.C. The
Lapita were skilled navigators and evidence of their pottery around
the Pacific has served as a guide for understanding human expansion
in the region. Successive waves of migrants from other islands in
Melanesia intermarried with the Lapita, giving rise to the Kanak
ethnic group considered indigenous to New Caledonia. British
explorer James COOK was the first European to visit New Caledonia
in 1774, giving it the Latin name for Scotland. Missionaries first
landed in New Caledonia in 1840. In 1853, France annexed New
Caledonia to preclude any British attempt to claim the island.
France declared it a penal colony in 1864 and sent more than 20,000
prisoners to New Caledonia in the ensuing three decades.<br/>
         <br/>
Nickel was discovered in 1864 and French prisoners were directed to
mine it. France brought in indentured servants and enslaved labor
from elsewhere in Southeast Asia to work the mines, blocking Kanaks
from accessing the most profitable part of the local economy. In
1878, High Chief ATAI led a rebellion against French rule. The
Kanaks were relegated to reservations, leading to periodic smaller
uprisings and culminating in a large revolt in 1917 that was
brutally suppressed by colonial authorities. During World War II,
New Caledonia became an important base for Allied troops, and the
US moved its South Pacific headquarters to the island in 1942.
Following the war, New Caledonia was made an overseas territory and
French citizenship was granted to all inhabitants in 1953, thereby
permitting the Kanaks to move off the reservations.<br/>
         <br/>
The Kanak nationalist movement began in the 1950s, but most voters
chose to remain a territory in an independence referendum in 1958.
The European population of New Caledonia boomed in the 1970s with a
renewed focus on nickel mining, reigniting Kanak nationalism. Key
Kanak leaders were assassinated in the early 1980s, leading to
escalating violence and dozens of fatalities. The Matignon Accords
of 1988 provided for a 10-year transition period. The Noumea Accord
of 1998 transferred increasing governing responsibility from France
to New Caledonia over a 20-year period and provided for three
independence referenda. In the first held in 2018, voters rejected
independence by 57% to 43%; in the second held in 2020, voters
rejected independence 53% to 47%. In the third referendum held in
December 2021, voters rejected independence 96% to 4%; however, a
boycott by key Kanak groups spurred challenges about the legitimacy
of the vote. In February 2021, pro-independence parties gained a
majority in the New Caledonian Government for the first time.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: New Caledonia’s telecom
sector provides fixed and mobile voice services, mobile internet,
fixed broadband access, and wholesale services for other ISPs; the
country is well serviced by extensive 3G and LTE networks, and is
considered to have one of the highest smartphone adoption rates in
the Pacific region; by 2025, smart phone penetration is expected to
reach 71%; while DSL is still the dominant fixed broadband
technology, and a nationwide FttP network; the South Pacific region
has become a hub for submarine cable system developments in recent
years, with further networks scheduled to come online later in 2021
and into 2022; these new cables are expected to increase
competition in the region with regards to international capacity;
in 2020, the government owned telco commissioned Alcatel Submarine
Networks (ASN) to build the Gondwana-2 cable system to provide
additional network capacity and complement the Gondwana-1 cable

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
