   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">In 1603, after decades of civil warfare, the Tokugawa shogunate
(a military-led, dynastic government) ushered in a long period of
relative political stability and isolation from foreign influence.
For more than two centuries this policy enabled Japan to enjoy a
flowering of its indigenous culture. Japan opened its ports after
signing the Treaty of Kanagawa with the US in 1854 and began to
intensively modernize and industrialize. During the late 19th and
early 20th centuries, Japan became a regional power that was able
to defeat the forces of both China and Russia. It occupied Korea,
Formosa (Taiwan), and southern Sakhalin Island. In 1931-32 Japan
occupied Manchuria, and in 1937 it launched a full-scale invasion
of China. Japan attacked US forces in 1941 - triggering America's
entry into World War II - and soon occupied much of East and
Southeast Asia. After its defeat in World War II, Japan recovered
to become an economic power and an ally of the US. While the
emperor retains his throne as a symbol of national unity, elected
politicians hold actual decision-making power. Following three
decades of unprecedented growth, Japan's economy experienced a
major slowdown starting in the 1990s, but the country remains an
economic power. In March 2011, Japan's strongest-ever earthquake,
and an accompanying tsunami, devastated the northeast part of
Honshu island, killed thousands, and damaged several nuclear power
plants. Prime Minister Shinzo ABE was reelected to office in
December 2012, and embarked on ambitious economic and security
reforms to improve Japan's economy and bolster the country's
international standing. In November 2019, ABE became Japan's
longest-serving post-war prime minister; he resigned in September
2020 and was succeeded by Yoshihide SUGA. Fumio KISHIDA became
prime minister in October 2021.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Japan has one of the best
developed telecom markets globally, the fixed-line segment remains
stagnant and the focus for growth is in the mobile sector; the MNOs
have shifted their investment from LTE to 5G, and growth in 5G
showed early promise although there have been recent setbacks;
these have partly been attributed to the economic difficulties, the
impact of restrictions imposed during the pandemic, and
unfavourable investment climate (not helped by the delay of the
Tokyo Olympics from 2020 to 2021), and to restrictions in the
supply of 5G-enabled devices; the fixed broadband market is
dominated by fiber, with a strong cable platform also evident;
fiber will continue to increase its share of the fixed broadband
market, largely at the expense of DSL; the mobile market is
dominated by three MNOs, mobile broadband subscriber growth is
expected to be relatively low over the next five years, partly due
to the high existing subscriptions though growth has been
stimulated by measures which have encouraged people to school and
work from home; there has also been a boost in accessing
entertainment via mobile devices since 2020; plans to provide 55%
population coverage with 5G by March 2022 and nationwide 5G
coverage by 2023 (2021)<br/>

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

      <subsection title="Military - note">Japan was disarmed after its defeat in World War II; shortly
after the Korean War began in 1950, US occupation forces in Japan
created a 75,000-member lightly armed force called the National
Police Reserve; the current Self Defense Force was founded in
1954<br/>
         <br/>
in addition to having one of the region’s largest and best equipped
militaries, Japan’s alliance with the US (signed in 1951) is one of
the cornerstones of the country’s security, as well as a large part
of the US security role in Asia; as of 2023, approximately 55,000
US troops and other military assets, including aircraft and naval
ships, were stationed in Japan and had exclusive use of more than
80 bases and facilities; in exchange for their use, the US
guarantees Japan’s security; the Japanese Government provides about
$2 billion per year to offset the cost of stationing US forces in
Japan; in addition, it pays compensation to localities hosting US
troops, rent for bases, and costs for new facilities to support the
US presence<br/>
         <br/>
Japan has Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA) status with the US; MNNA is a
designation under US law that provides foreign partners with
certain benefits in the areas of defense trade and security
cooperation; while MNNA status provides military and economic
privileges, it does not entail any security commitments (2023)</subsection>
