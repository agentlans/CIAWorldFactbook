   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Malaysia’s location has long made it an important cultural,
economic, historical, social, and trade link between the islands of
Southeast Asia and the mainland. Through the Strait of Malacca,
which separates the Malay Peninsula from the archipelago, flowed
maritime trade and with it influences from China, India, the Middle
East, and the east coast of Africa. Prior to the 14th century,
several powerful maritime empires existed in what is modern-day
Malaysia, including the Srivijayan, which controlled much of the
southern part of the peninsula between the 7th and 13th centuries,
and the Majapahit Empire, which took control over most of the
peninsula and the Malay Archipelago between the 13th and 14th
centuries. The adoption of Islam between the 13th and 17th
centuries also saw the rise of a number of powerful maritime states
and sultanates on the Malay Peninsula and the island of Borneo,
such as the port city of Malacca (Melaka), which at its height in
the 15th century had a navy and hosted thousands of Chinese, Arab,
Persian, and Indian merchants.

The Portuguese in the 16th century and the Dutch in the 17th
century were the first European colonial powers to establish
themselves on the Malay Peninsula and Southeast Asia. However, it
was the British who ultimately secured their hegemony across the
territory and during the late 18th and 19th centuries established
colonies and protectorates in the area that is now Malaysia. These
holdings were occupied by Japan from 1942 to 1945. In 1948, the
British-ruled territories on the Malay Peninsula except Singapore
formed the Federation of Malaya, which became independent in 1957.
Malaysia was formed in 1963 when the former British colonies of
Singapore, as well as Sabah and Sarawak on the northern coast of
Borneo, joined the Federation. The first several years of the
country's independence were marred by a communist insurgency,
Indonesian confrontation with Malaysia, Philippine claims to Sabah,
and Singapore's expulsion in 1965. During the 22-year term of Prime
Minister MAHATHIR Mohamad (1981-2003), Malaysia was successful in
diversifying its economy from dependence on exports of raw
materials to the development of manufacturing, services, and
tourism. Prime Minister MAHATHIR and a newly formed coalition of
opposition parties defeated Prime Minister Mohamed NAJIB bin Abdul
Razak's United Malays National Organization (UMNO) in May 2018,
ending over 60 years of uninterrupted rule by UMNO. Since 2018,
Malaysia has undergone considerable political upheaval with a
succession of coalition governments holding power.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Malaysia’s multi-ethnic population consists of the bumiputera –
Malays and other indigenous peoples – (62%), ethnic Chinese (21%),
ethnic Indians (6%), and foreigners (10%).  The majority of
Malaysia’s ethnic Chinese and Indians trace their roots to the
British colonialists’ recruitment of hundreds of thousands of
Chinese and Indians as mine and plantation workers between the
early-19th century and the 1930s.  Most Malays have
maintained their rural lifestyle, while the entrepreneurial Chinese
have achieved greater wealth and economic dominance.  In order
to eradicate Malay poverty, the Malaysian Government in 1971
adopted policies that gave preference to the bumiputera in public
university admissions, government jobs and contracts, and property
ownership.  Affirmative action continues to benefit well-off
urban bumiputera but has done little to alleviate poverty for their
more numerous rural counterparts.  The policies have pushed
ethnic Chinese and Indians to study at private or foreign
universities (many do not return) and have created and sustained
one of the world’s largest civil services, which is 85-90%
Malay. The country’s age structure has changed significantly since the
1960s, as fertility and mortality rates have declined.
 Malaysia’s total fertility rate (TFR) has dropped from 5
children per woman in 1970, to 3 in 1998, to 2.1 in 2015 as a
result of increased educational attainment and labor participation
among women, later marriages, increased use of contraception, and
changes in family size preference related to urbanization. 
The TFR is higher among Malays, rural residents (who are mainly
Malay), the poor, and the less-educated.  Despite the reduced
fertility rate, Malaysia’s population will continue to grow, albeit
at a decreasing rate, for the next few decades because of its large
number of reproductive-age women.  The youth population has
been shrinking, and the working-age population (15-64 year olds)
has been growing steadily.  Malaysia’s labor market has
successfully absorbed the increasing number of job seekers, leading
to sustained economic growth.  However, the favorable age
structure is changing, and around 2020, Malaysia will start to
become a rapidly aging society.  As the population ages,
Malaysia will need to better educate and train its labor force,
raise productivity, and continue to increase the number of women
workers in order to further develop its economy.More than 1.8 million Malaysians lived abroad as of 2015,
including anywhere from 350,000 to 785,000 workers, more than half
of whom have an advanced level of education.  The vast
majority of emigrants are ethnic Chinese, seeking better
educational and job opportunities abroad because of
institutionalized ethnic discrimination favoring the Malays. 
The primary destination country is nearby Singapore, followed by
Bangladesh and Australia.  Hundreds of thousands of Malaysians
also commute across the causeway to Singapore daily for work.Brain drain is an impediment to Malaysia’s goal of becoming a
high-income country.  The situation is compounded by a migrant
inflow that is composed almost entirely of low-skilled laborers who
work mainly in manufacturing, agriculture, and construction. 
Officially, Malaysia had about 1.8 million legal foreign workers as
of mid-year 2017 – largely from Indonesia, Nepal, the Philippines,
and Bangladesh – but as many as 3 to 4 million are estimated to be
in the country illegally.  Immigrants outnumber ethnic Indians
and could supplant the ethnic Chinese as Malaysia’s second largest
population group around 2035.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">as part of a diverse range of initiatives designed to move the country from developing to developed status by 2025, Malaysia has enabled and encouraged open competition in its telecommunications market; the result is very high penetration levels in both the mobile (147%) and mobile broadband (127%) segments, and near-universal coverage of 4G LTE networks; steady growth is occurring as more fiber optic cable networks are being deployed around the country; consumers are the main beneficiaries of the highly competitive market; they enjoy widespread access to high-speed mobile services as well as attractive offers on bundles to keep data use up but prices low; the downside is that most of Malaysia’s MNOs and MVNOs have struggled to increase revenue in line with growth in subscriber numbers as well as demand for broadband data; while the operators have been very successful in moving a significant proportion (now over 30%) of customers from prepaid over to higher-value postpaid accounts, ARPU continues to fall year after year as a result of competitive pricing pressures; the mobile market, in particular, has become overcrowded and the government is keen to see further rationalization and consolidation with the operators; while customers will no doubt continue to enjoy high quality services at competitive rates, the new entity will be hopeful of squeezing better margins through improved economies of scale; the government’s next move is to encourage the private mobile operators to sign up to the country’s wholesale 5G network; this will develop and deploy the 5G infrastructure across the country; the government’s stated intent was to avoid duplication of networks and infrastructure, and thus reduce investment costs for the operators; to date, no MNO has agreed to the deal and are instead demanding the development of a dual wholesale network model (one that no doubt offers more flexible terms, at least in the eyes of the MNOs); Malaysia’s 5G rollout has, in effect, come to a standstill while the government tries to find a way to restart negotiations (2022)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>

      <subsection title="Military - note">maritime security has long been a top priority for the Malaysian
Armed Forces, but it has received even greater emphasis in the
2000s, particularly anti-piracy operations in the Strait of Malacca
and countering Chinese naval incursions in Malaysia’s Economic
Exclusion Zone, as well as addressing identified shortfalls in
maritime capabilities; as such, it has undertaken modest efforts to
procure more modern ships, improve air and maritime surveillance,
expand the Navy’s support infrastructure (particularly bases/ports)
and domestic ship-building capacities, restructure naval command
and control, and increase naval cooperation with regional and
international partners; as of 2022, for example, the Navy had 5
frigates on order, which would increase the number of operational
frigates from 2 to 7; in addition, it began tri-lateral air and
naval patrols with Indonesia and the Philippines in 2017; Malaysia
also cooperates closely with the US military, including on maritime
surveillance and participating regularly in bilateral and
multilateral training exercises

Malaysia is a member of the Five Powers Defense Arrangements
(FPDA), a series of mutual assistance agreements reached in 1971
embracing Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and the UK;
the FPDA commits the members to consult with one another in the
event or threat of an armed attack on any of the members and to
mutually decide what measures should be taken, jointly or
separately; there is no specific obligation to intervene militarily

      <subsection title="Maritime threats">the International Maritime Bureau reports the territorial and
offshore waters in the South China Sea as high risk for piracy and
armed robbery against ships; numerous commercial vessels have been
attacked and hijacked both at anchor and while underway; hijacked
vessels are often disguised and cargo diverted to ports in East
Asia; crews have been murdered or cast adrift; the Singapore
Straits saw 35 attacks against commercial vessels in 2021, a 50%
increase over 2020 and the highest number of incidents reported
since 1992; vessels were boarded in 33 of the 35 incidents, one
crew was injured, another assaulted and two threatened during these
incidents</subsection>

         <note title="tier rating">Tier 2 Watch List — Malaysia does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking but is making significant efforts to do so; the government identified more victims, increased the number of trafficking-specialist prosecutors, drafted victim identification standard operating procedures, identified two volunteer victim assistance specialists that worked with more than 100 victims, and co-hosted the first national conference on anti-trafficking; however, authorities prosecuted and convicted fewer traffickers and investigated few trafficking cases; despite the issue of corruption, insufficient efforts were made to prosecute officials’ complicity in trafficking-related crimes or to report the results of investigations into such crimes; insufficient interagency coordination and victim services discouraged foreign victims from participating in criminal proceedings; no resources were devoted to a written plan that, if implemented, would constitute significant efforts to meet the minimum standards; Malaysia was granted a waiver per the Trafficking Victims Protection Act from an otherwise required downgrade to Tier 3 (2020)</note>
