      <subsection title="Background">Founded in 963, Luxembourg became a grand duchy in 1815 and an
independent state under the Netherlands. It lost more than half of
its territory to Belgium in 1839 but gained a larger measure of
autonomy. In 1867, Luxembourg attained full independence under the
condition that it promise perpetual neutrality. Overrun by Germany
in both world wars, it ended its neutrality in 1948 when it entered
into the Benelux Customs Union and when it joined NATO the
following year. In 1957, Luxembourg became one of the six founding
countries of the EEC (later the EU), and in 1999 it joined the euro
currency zone.</subsection>

telecom sector; there remains some pressure from regulatory
measures, though no further reductions to fixed and mobile
interconnection tariffs have been imposed through to 2024; high
mobile penetration has slowed subscriber growth in the mobile

registration has not had an adverse effect on the number of mobile

cards (2021)<br/>

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
