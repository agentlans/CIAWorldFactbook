   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Founded in 963, Luxembourg became a grand duchy in 1815 and an
independent state under the Netherlands. It lost more than half of
its territory to Belgium in 1839 but gained a larger measure of
autonomy. In 1867, Luxembourg attained full independence under the
condition that it promise perpetual neutrality. Overrun by Germany
in both world wars, it ended its neutrality in 1948 when it entered
into the Benelux Customs Union and when it joined NATO the
following year. In 1957, Luxembourg became one of the six founding
countries of the EEC (later the EU), and in 1999 it joined the euro
currency zone.</subsection>
