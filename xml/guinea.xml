   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Guinea's deep Muslim heritage arrived via the neighboring
Almoravid Empire in the 11th century. Following Almoravid decline,
Guinea existed on the fringe of several African kingdoms, all
competing for regional dominance. In the 13th century, the Mali
Empire took control of Guinea, encouraging its already growing
Muslim faith. After the fall of the West African empires, various
smaller kingdoms controlled Guinea. In the 18th century, Fulani
Muslims established an Islamic state in central Guinea that
represents one of the earliest examples of a written constitution
and alternating leadership. While European traders first arrived in
the 16th century, it was the French who secured colonial rule in
the 19th century.In 1958, Guinea achieved independence from France. Sekou TOURE
became Guinea’s first post-independence president; he established a
dictatorial regime and ruled until his death in 1984, after which
General Lansana CONTE staged a coup and seized the government. He
too established an authoritarian regime and manipulated
presidential elections until his death in December 2008, when
Captain Moussa Dadis CAMARA led a military coup, seized power, and
suspended the constitution. In September 2009, presidential guards
opened fire on an opposition rally, killing more than 150 people in
Conakry, the capital. In early December 2009, CAMARA was wounded in
an assassination attempt and exiled to Burkina Faso. In 2010 and
2013 respectively, the country held its first free and fair
presidential and legislative elections. Alpha CONDE won the 2010
and 2015 presidential elections. CONDE's first cabinet was the
first all-civilian government in Guinean history. In March 2020,
Guinea passed a new constitution in a national referendum that
changed presidential term limit rules. CONDE argued that, given
this change, he was allowed to run for a third term, which he then
won in October 2020. On 5 September 2021, Col Mamady DOUMBOUYA led
special forces troops in a successful military coup, ousting and
detaining CONDE and establishing the National Committee for
Reconciliation and Development (CNRD). DOUMBOUYA and the CNRD
suspended the constitution and dissolved the government and the
legislature. DOUMBOUYA was sworn in as transition president on 1
October 2021, and appointed Mohamed BEAVOGUI as transition prime
minister a week later. BEAVOGUI subsequently formed a largely
technocratic cabinet. The National Transition Council (CNT), which
acts as the legislative body for the transition, was formed on 22
January 2022. The 81-member CNT is led by Dr. Dansa KOUROUMA and
consists of appointed members representing a broad swath of Guinean
society.

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Guinea’s strong population growth is a result of declining
mortality rates and sustained elevated fertility. The population
growth rate was somewhat tempered in the 2000s because of a period
of net outmigration. Although life expectancy and mortality rates
have improved over the last two decades, the nearly universal
practice of female genital cutting continues to contribute to high
infant and maternal mortality rates. Guinea’s total fertility
remains high at about 5 children per woman as of 2022 because of
the ongoing preference for larger families, low contraceptive usage
and availability, a lack of educational attainment and empowerment
among women, and poverty. A lack of literacy and vocational
training programs limit job prospects for youths, but even those
with university degrees often have no option but to work in the
informal sector. About 60% of the country’s large youth population
is unemployed.Tensions and refugees have spilled over Guinea’s borders with
Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Cote d’Ivoire. During the 1990s Guinea
harbored as many as half a million refugees from Sierra Leone and
Liberia, more refugees than any other African country for much of
that decade. About half sought refuge in the volatile "Parrot’s
Beak" region of southwest Guinea, a wedge of land jutting into
Sierra Leone near the Liberian border. Many were relocated within
Guinea in the early 2000s because the area suffered repeated
cross-border attacks from various government and rebel forces, as
well as anti-refugee violence.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Maritime threats">the International Maritime Bureau reports the territorial and
offshore waters in the Niger Delta and Gulf of Guinea remain a very
high risk for piracy and armed robbery of ships; in 2021, there
were 34 reported incidents of piracy and armed robbery at sea in
the Gulf of Guinea region; although a significant decrease from the
total number of 81 incidents in 2020, it included the one hijacking
and three of five ships fired upon worldwide; while boarding and
attempted boarding to steal valuables from ships and crews are the
most common types of incidents, almost a third of all incidents
involve a hijacking and/or kidnapping; in 2021, 57 crew members
were kidnapped in seven separate incidents in the Gulf of Guinea,
representing 100% of kidnappings worldwide; Nigerian pirates in
particular are well armed and very aggressive, operating as far as
200 nm offshore; the Maritime Administration of the US Department
of Transportation has issued a Maritime Advisory (2022-001 - Gulf
of Guinea-Piracy/Armed Robbery/Kidnapping for Ransom) effective 4
January 2022, which states in part, "Piracy, armed robbery, and
kidnapping for ransom continue to serve as significant threats to
US-flagged vessels transiting or operating in the Gulf of

         <note title="tier rating">Tier 2 Watch List — Guinea does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however it is making significant efforts to do so; the government  drafted a new anti-trafficking action plan, provided support to eight victims exploited in the Middle East, and incorporated anti-trafficking training into the law enforcement curriculum; however, the government did not overall increase efforts compared to the last rating period; investigations and prosecutions of trafficking crimes decreased, victim identification was inadequate, and NGO’s providing victim services did not receive government support; for the fourth year, resources for the anti-trafficking committee or the Office for the Protection of Gender, Children and Morals were inadequate; a Quranic teacher was not prosecuted for allegedly forcing child begging; Guinea was downgraded to Tier 2 Watch List (2020)</note>
         <note title="trafficking profile">Guinea is a source, transit, and, to a lesser extent, a destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking; the majority of trafficking victims are Guinean children; Guinean girls are subjected to domestic servitude and commercial sexual exploitation, while boys are forced to beg, work as street vendors, shoe shiners, or miners; some Guinean children are forced to mine in Senegal, Mali, and possibly other West African countries; Guinean women and girls are subjected to domestic servitude and sex trafficking in Nigeria, Cote d’Ivoire, Benin, Senegal, Greece, and Spain, while Chinese and Vietnamese women are reportedly forced into prostitution in Guinea</note>
