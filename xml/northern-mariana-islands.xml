   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Northern Mariana Islands were settled by Austronesian people
around 1500 B.C. These people became the indigenous Chamorro and
were influenced by later migrations, including of Micronesians in
the first century A.D., and island Southeast Asians around 900.
Spanish explorer Ferdinand MAGELLAN sailed through the Mariana
Islands in 1521 and Spain claimed them in 1565. Spain formally
colonized the Mariana Islands in 1668 and administered the
archipelago from Guam. Spain’s brutal repression of the Chamorro,
along with new diseases and intermittent warfare, reduced the
indigenous population by about 90% in the 1700s. With a similar
dynamic occurring on Guam, Spain forced the Chamorro from the
Northern Mariana Islands to resettle on Guam and prevented them
from returning to their home islands. By the time the Northern
Mariana Islands’ Chamorro returned, many other Micronesians,
including Chuukese and Yapese, had already settled on their
islands.

In 1898, Spain ceded Guam to the US following the Spanish-American
War but sold the Northern Mariana Islands to Germany under the
German-Spanish Treaty of 1899. Germany administered the territory
from German New Guinea but took a hands-off approach to day-to-day
life. Following World War I, Japan administered the islands under a
League of Nations mandate. Japan focused on sugar production and
brought in thousands of Japanese laborers, who quickly outnumbered
the Chamorro on the islands. During World War II, Japan invaded
Guam from the Northern Mariana Islands and used Marianan Chamorro
as translators with Guamanian Chamorro, creating friction between
the two Chamorro communities that continues to this day. The US
captured the Northern Mariana Islands in 1944 after the Battle of
Saipan and administered them post-World War II as part of the Trust
Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI).

On four occasions in the 1950s and 1960s, voters opted for
integration with Guam, although Guam rejected it in 1969. In 1978,
the Northern Mariana Islands was granted self-government separate
from the rest of the TTPI and in 1986, islanders were granted US
citizenship and the territory came under US sovereignty as the
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). In 2009, the
CNMI became the final US territory to elect a nonvoting delegate to
the US Congress.</subsection>
