   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">For much of its history, Guinea-Bissau was under the control of
the Mali Empire and the Kaabu Kingdom. In the 16th century,
Portugal began establishing trading posts along Guinea-Bissau’s
shoreline. Initially, the Portuguese were restricted to the
coastline and islands. However, the slave and gold trades were
lucrative to local African leaders, and the Portuguese were slowly
able to expand their power and influence inland. Starting in the
18th century, the Mali Empire and Kingdom of Kaabu slowly
disintegrated into smaller local entities. By the 19th century,
Portugal had fully incorporated Guinea-Bissau into its
empire.

Since gaining independence in 1974, Guinea-Bissau has experienced
considerable political and military upheaval. In 1980, a military
coup established General Joao Bernardo 'Nino' VIEIRA as president.
VIEIRA's regime suppressed political opposition and purged
political rivals. Several coup attempts through the 1980s and early
1990s failed to unseat him. In May 1999, a military mutiny and
civil war led to VIEIRA's ouster. In February 2000, a transitional
government turned over power to opposition leader Kumba YALA. In
September 2003, a bloodless military coup overthrew YALA and
installed businessman Henrique ROSA as interim president. In 2005,
former President VIEIRA was reelected, pledging to pursue economic
development and national reconciliation; he was assassinated in
March 2009. In June 2009, Malam Bacai SANHA was elected president,
but he passed away in January 2012 from a long-term illness. In
April 2012, a military coup prevented the second-round of the
presidential election from taking place. Following mediation from
the Economic Community of Western African States, a civilian
transitional government assumed power. In 2014, Jose Mario VAZ was
elected president after a free and fair election. In June 2019, VAZ
became the first president in Guinea-Bissau’s history to complete a
full presidential term. Umaro Sissoco EMBALO was elected president
in December 2019, but he did not take office until February 2020
because of a prolonged challenge to the election results.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Guinea-Bissau’s young and growing population is sustained by
high fertility; approximately 60% of the population is under the
age of 25 as of 2020. Its large reproductive-age population and
total fertility rate of more than 4 children per woman offsets the
country’s high infant and maternal mortality rates. The latter is
among the world’s highest because of the prevalence of early
childbearing, a lack of birth spacing, the high percentage of
births outside of health care facilities, and a shortage of
medicines and supplies.Guinea-Bissau’s history of political instability, a civil war,
and several coups (the latest in 2012) have resulted in a fragile
state with a weak economy, high unemployment, rampant corruption,
widespread poverty, and thriving drug and child trafficking. With
the country lacking educational infrastructure, school funding and
materials, and qualified teachers, and with the cultural emphasis
placed on religious education, parents frequently send boys to
study in residential Koranic schools (daaras) in Senegal and The
Gambia. They often are extremely deprived and are forced into
street begging or agricultural work by marabouts (Muslim religious
teachers), who enrich themselves at the expense of the children.
Boys who leave their marabouts often end up on the streets of Dakar
or other large Senegalese towns and are vulnerable to even worse
abuse.Some young men lacking in education and job prospects become
involved in the flourishing international drug trade. Local drug
use and associated violent crime are growing.</subsection>
