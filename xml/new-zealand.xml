   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Polynesian settlers may have arrived in New Zealand in the late
1200s, with widespread settlement in the mid-1300s. They called the
land Aotearoa, which legend holds is the name of the canoe that
Kupe, the first Polynesian in New Zealand, used to sail to the
country; the name Aotearoa is now in widespread use as the local
Maori name for the country. Competition for land and resources led
to intermittent fighting between different Maori iwi (tribes) by
the 1500s as large game became extinct. Dutch explorer Abel TASMAN
was the first European to see the islands in 1642 but after an
encounter with local Maori, he sailed away. British captain James
COOK was the next European to arrive in New Zealand in 1769,
followed by whalers, sealers, and traders. The UK only nominally
claimed New Zealand and included it as part of New South Wales in
Australia. Concerns about increasing lawlessness led the UK to
appoint its first British Resident in New Zealand in 1832, although
he had few legal powers. In 1835, some Maori iwi from the North
Island declared independence as the United Tribes of New Zealand.
Fearing an impending French settlement and takeover, they asked the
British for protection. In 1840, the British negotiated their
protection in the Treaty of Waitangi, which was eventually signed
by more than 500 different Maori chiefs, although many chiefs did
not or were not asked to sign. In the English-language version of
the treaty, the British thought the Maori ceded their land to the
UK, but translations of the treaty appeared to give the British
less authority, and land tenure issues stemming from the treaty are
still present and being actively negotiated in New Zealand.<br/>
         <br/>
The UK declared New Zealand a separate colony in 1841 and gave it
limited self-government in 1852. Different traditions of authority
and land use led to a series of wars from the 1840s to the 1870s
fought between Europeans and various Maori iwi. Along with disease,
these conflicts halved the Maori population. In the 1890s, New
Zealand initially expressed interest in joining independence talks
with Australia but ultimately opted against it and changed its
status to an independent dominion in 1907. New Zealand provided
more than 100,000 troops during each World War, many of whom fought
as part of the Australia and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC). New
Zealand reaffirmed its independence in 1947, signed the Australia,
New Zealand, and US (ANZUS) Treaty, and militarily supported the US
in the Korean and Vietnam Wars. Beginning in 1984, New Zealand
began to adopt nuclear-free policies, contributing to a dispute
with the US over naval ship visits that led the US to suspend its
defense obligations to New Zealand in 1986.<br/>
         <br/>
In recent years, New Zealand has explored reducing some of its ties
to the UK. There in an active, minority movement about changing New
Zealand to a republic, and in 2015-16, a referendum on changing the
New Zealand flag to remove the Union Jack failed 57% to 43%.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: the principal growth areas
in in New Zealand’s telecom market have been in mobile broadband
and fiber; the UFB1 rollout was completed in November 2019 and the
UFB2 rollout is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2022;
Chorus noted that as of the beginning of 2022, 1Gb/s plans
accounted for about 23% of all fiber connections, while 43% of
business customers adopted a gigabit service; New Zealand’s mobile
market continues to undergo significant developments; there have
been considerable gains made in LTE services, with effective
competition between Spark, Vodafone NZ, and 2degrees; the widening
coverage of LTE networks has been supported by the Rural Broadband
Initiative rollout, which added a significant number of mobile
sites to new or underserved areas; as the initiative is winding
down, this has enabled the participating telcos to invest in NB-IoT
and other platforms; Vodafone NZ expects to extend its NB-IoT
footprint to cover at least 60% of the country by 2024; the market
is undergoing additional consolidation, with approval of the merger
between 2degrees and Orcon Group having been granted by regulators
in May 2022; this will create the country’s third-largest
integrated telco, offering fixed and mobile services in competition
with Spark and Vodafone NZ. The merger proposal came fast of the
heels of Vocus Group and its local subsidiary Orcon having acquired
2degrees from Trilogy International in December 2021; this deal
created a new company, Voyage Digital. (2020)<br/>

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

      <subsection title="Military - note">New Zealand is a member of the Five Powers Defense Arrangements
(FPDA), a series of mutual assistance agreements reached in 1971
embracing Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and the UK;
the FPDA commits the members to consult with one another in the
event or threat of an armed attack on any of the members and to
mutually decide what measures should be taken, jointly or
separately; there is no specific obligation to intervene

New Zealand has been part of the Australia, New Zealand, and US
Security (ANZUS) Treaty since 1951; however, the US suspended its
ANZUS security obligations to New Zealand in 1986 after New Zealand
implemented a policy barring nuclear-armed and nuclear-powered
warships from its ports; the US and New Zealand signed the
Wellington Declaration in 2010, which reaffirmed close ties between
the two countries, and in 2012 signed the Washington Declaration,
which provided a framework for future security cooperation and
defense dialogues; in 2016, a US naval ship conducted the first
bilateral warship visit to New Zealand since the 1980s <br/>
         <br/>
New Zealand has Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA) status with the US; MNNA
is a designation under US law that provides foreign partners with
certain benefits in the areas of defense trade and security
cooperation; while MNNA status provides military and economic
privileges, it does not entail any security commitments (2022)</subsection>
