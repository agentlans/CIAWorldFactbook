   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Lucayan Indians inhabited the islands when Christopher COLUMBUS
first set foot in the New World on San Salvador in 1492. British
settlement of the islands began in 1647; the islands became a
colony in 1783. Piracy thrived in the 17th and 18th centuries
because of The Bahamas close proximity to shipping lanes. Since
attaining independence from the UK in 1973, The Bahamas has
prospered through tourism, international banking, and investment
management, which comprise up to 85% of GDP. Because of its
proximity to the US - the nearest Bahamian landmass being only 80
km (50 mi) from Florida - the country is a major transshipment
point for illicit trafficking, particularly to the US mainland, as
well as Europe. US law enforcement agencies cooperate closely with
The Bahamas, and the US Coast Guard assists Bahamian authorities in
maritime security and law enforcement through Operation Bahamas,
Turks and Caicos, or OPBAT.</subsection>

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
