   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Polynesians lived on Norfolk Island between 1200 and 1500 but
the remote island was uninhabited by the time British explorer
James COOK landed on the island in 1774. Two British attempts at
establishing the island as a penal colony (1788-1814 and 1825-55)
were ultimately abandoned.<br/>
         <br/>
In 1856, almost 200 Pitcairn Islanders - descendants of the Bounty
mutineers and their Tahitian companions - were relocated to Norfolk
Island because of overcrowding on the Pitcairn Islands. Some
returned to the Pitcairn Islands over the next few years but most
settled permanently on Norfolk Island and recreated the land tenure
and governance structures they previously had. Norfolk Island
retained a great degree of local control until 1897, when it became
a dependency of New South Wales. During World War II, Norfolk
Island was an airbase and an important refueling stop in the South
Pacific. In 1976, an Australian judge recommended Norfolk Island be
incorporated fully into Australia, which Norfolk Islanders
rejected. Following an appeal to the UN, Australia granted limited
self-government to Norfolk Island in 1979.<br/>
         <br/>
With growing financial troubles during the 2000s, Australia
abolished the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly in 2015, reduced
Norfolk Islandâ€™s autonomy in 2016, and suspended the local council
in 2020. Most services are provided by a mix of the Australian
Capital Territory and the states of New South Wales and Queensland.
These moves were unpopular on Norfolk Island, which has sought to
have its self-government restored.</subsection>
