   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Slovakia traces its roots to the 9th century state of Great
Moravia. Subsequently, the Slovaks became part of the Hungarian
Kingdom, where they remained for the next 1,000 years. After the
formation of the dual Austro-Hungarian monarchy in 1867, backlash
to language and education policies favoring the use of Hungarian
(Magyarization) encouraged the strengthening of Slovak nationalism
and a cultivation of cultural ties with the closely related Czechs,
who fell administratively under the Austrian half of the empire.
After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the close
of World War I, the Slovaks joined the Czechs to form
Czechoslovakia. The new state was envisioned as a nation with Czech
and Slovak branches. During the interwar period, Slovak nationalist
leaders pushed for autonomy within Czechoslovakia, and in 1939
Slovakia became an independent state created by and allied with
Nazi Germany. Following World War II, Czechoslovakia was
reconstituted and came under communist rule within Soviet-dominated
Eastern Europe. In 1968, an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended
the efforts of Czechoslovakia's leaders to liberalize communist
rule and create "socialism with a human face," ushering in a period
of repression known as "normalization." The peaceful "Velvet
Revolution" swept the Communist Party from power at the end of 1989
and inaugurated a return to democratic rule and a market economy.
On 1 January 1993, Czechoslovakia underwent a nonviolent "velvet
divorce" into its two national components, Slovakia and the Czech
Republic. Slovakia joined both NATO and the EU in the spring of
2004 and the euro zone on 1 January 2009.</subsection>

improve river navigability, and to generate electricity; when
Hungary suspended work on the project until its environmental

adopted a pared down strategy to divert the Danube so that all
construction was within Czechoslovakian territory; Hungary
terminated the project on environmental and economic grounds in
1989, and in 1992 both countries took the matter to the
International Court of Justice (ICJ); the ICJ found largely in
