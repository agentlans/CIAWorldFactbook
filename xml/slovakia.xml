   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Slovakia traces its roots to the 9th century state of Great
Moravia. Subsequently, the Slovaks became part of the Hungarian
Kingdom, where they remained for the next 1,000 years. After the
formation of the dual Austro-Hungarian monarchy in 1867, backlash
to language and education policies favoring the use of Hungarian
(Magyarization) encouraged the strengthening of Slovak nationalism
and a cultivation of cultural ties with the closely related Czechs,
who fell administratively under the Austrian half of the empire.
After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the close
of World War I, the Slovaks joined the Czechs to form
Czechoslovakia. The new state was envisioned as a nation with Czech
and Slovak branches. During the interwar period, Slovak nationalist
leaders pushed for autonomy within Czechoslovakia, and in 1939
Slovakia became an independent state created by and allied with
Nazi Germany. Following World War II, Czechoslovakia was
reconstituted and came under communist rule within Soviet-dominated
Eastern Europe. In 1968, an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended
the efforts of Czechoslovakia's leaders to liberalize communist
rule and create "socialism with a human face," ushering in a period
of repression known as "normalization." The peaceful "Velvet
Revolution" swept the Communist Party from power at the end of 1989
and inaugurated a return to democratic rule and a market economy.
On 1 January 1993, Czechoslovakia underwent a nonviolent "velvet
divorce" into its two national components, Slovakia and the Czech
Republic. Slovakia joined both NATO and the EU in the spring of
2004 and the euro zone on 1 January 2009.</subsection>

shown steady growth in recent years; fiber has become the principal
platform for fixed broadband services, followed by DSL; the cable
sector is a distant third in terms of subscribers, though cable is
particularly strong in urban areas; mobile broadband access and
content services are developing rapidly in line with operators
having upgraded their networks; the regulator prepared the
groundwork for 5G services in line with European Union
requirements, with concessions in the 3.5GHz range followed by
those in the 700MHz, 900MHz and 1800MHz bands; 5G was launched in
late 2021 and is expected to cover about a fifth of the population
by the end of 2022 (2021)<br/>

domestic: four companies have a license to operate
cellular networks and provide nationwide cellular services; a few
other companies provide services but do not have their own

international: country code - 421; 3 international

telecommunications projects that will increase the availability of
external services; connects to DREAM cable (2017)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

Treaty, Hungary and formerly Czechoslovakia agreed to a

at Gabcikovo (Slovakia) and Nagymaros (Hungary) to prevent floods,
improve river navigability, and to generate electricity; when
Hungary suspended work on the project until its environmental

construction was within Czechoslovakian territory; Hungary
terminated the project on environmental and economic grounds in
1989, and in 1992 both countries took the matter to the
