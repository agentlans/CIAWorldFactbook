   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">This desolate, arctic, mountainous island was named after a
Dutch whaling captain who indisputably discovered it in 1614
(earlier claims are inconclusive). Visited only occasionally by
seal hunters and trappers over the following centuries, the island
came under Norwegian sovereignty in 1929. The long dormant
Beerenberg volcano, the northernmost active volcano on earth,
resumed activity in 1970 and the most recent eruption occurred in
1985.</subsection>
