   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">French Polynesia consists of five archipelagos - the Austral
Islands, the Gambier Islands, the Marquesas Islands, the Society
Islands, and the Tuamotu Archipelago. The Marquesas were first
settled around 200 B.C. and the Society Islands around A.D. 300.
Raiatea in the Society Islands became a center for religion and
culture. Exploration of the other islands emanated from Raiatea and
by 1000, there were small permanent settlements in all the island
groups. Ferdinand MAGELLAN was the first European to see the
islands of French Polynesia in 1520, and successive European
voyagers traveled through them over the next two centuries. In
1767, British explorer Samuel WALLIS was the first European to
visit Tahiti, followed by French navigator Louis Antoine de
BOUGAINVILLE in 1768, and British explorer James COOK in 1769. King
POMARE I united Tahiti and surrounding islands into the Kingdom of
Tahiti in 1788. Protestant missionaries arrived in 1797 and POMARE
I’s successor converted in the 1810s, along with most Tahitians. In
the 1830s, Queen POMARE IV refused to allow French Catholic
missionaries to operate, leading France to declare a protectorate
over Tahiti and fight the French-Tahitian War of the 1840s in an
attempt to annex the islands. POMARE IV requested British
assistance to fight France, and while the UK did not provide
material support, it did diplomatically pressure France to simply
maintain its protectorate status.<br/>
         <br/>
In 1880, King POMARE V ceded Tahiti and its possessions to France,
changing its status into a colony. France then claimed the Gambier
Islands and Tuamotu Archipelago and by 1901 had incorporated all
five island groups into its establishments in Oceania. A Tahitian
nationalist movement formed in 1940, leading France to grant French
citizenship to the islanders in 1946 and change it to an overseas
territory. In 1957, the islands’ name was changed to French
Polynesia and the following year, 64% of voters chose to stay part
of France when they approved a new constitution. Uninhabited
Mururoa Atoll was established as a French nuclear test site in 1962
and tests were conducted between 1966 and 1992 (underground
beginning in 1975). France also conducted tests at Fangataufa
Atoll, including its last nuclear test in 1996.<br/>
         <br/>
France granted French Polynesia partial internal autonomy in 1977
and expanded autonomy in 1984. French Polynesia was converted into
an overseas collectivity in 2003 and renamed an overseas country
inside the Republic in 2004. Proindependence politicians won a
surprise majority in local elections that same year but in
subsequent elections have been relegated to a vocal minority. In
2013, French Polynesia was relisted on the UN List of Non-Self
Governing Territories.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: French Polynesia has one of
the most advanced telecoms infrastructures in the Pacific Islands
region; the remoteness of the country with its scattering of 130
islands and atolls has made connectivity vital for its inhabitants;
the first submarine cable was deployed in 2010 and since then
additional cables have been connected to the islands, vastly
improving French Polynesia’s international connectivity; an
additional domestic submarine cable, the Natitua Sud, will connect
more remote islands by the end of 2022; French Polynesia is also a
hub for satellite communications in the region; a considerable
number of consumers access FttP-based services; with the first data
center in French Polynesia on the cards, the quality and price of
broadband services is expected to improve as content will be able
to be cached locally, reducing costs for consumers; for 2022, fixed
broadband subscriptions reached an estimated 22%; about 43% of the
country’s mobile connections are on 3G networks, while LTE accounts
for 12%; by 2025, LTE is expected to account for more than half of
all connections; it is also estimated that 77% of mobile
subscribers will have smart phones by 2025 (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line subscriptions nearly 33 per
100 persons and mobile-cellular density is roughly 119 per 100
persons (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 689; landing points
for the NATITUA, Manatua, and Honotua submarine cables to other
French Polynesian Islands, Cook Islands, Niue, Samoa and US;
satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Pacific Ocean) (2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
