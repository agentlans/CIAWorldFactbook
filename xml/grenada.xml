   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Carib Indians inhabited Grenada when Christopher COLUMBUS landed
on the island in 1498, but it remained uncolonized for more than a
century. The French settled Grenada in the 17th century,
established sugar estates, and imported large numbers of African
slaves. Britain took the island in 1762 and vigorously expanded
sugar production. In the 19th century, cacao eventually surpassed
sugar as the main export crop; in the 20th century, nutmeg became
the leading export. In 1967, Britain gave Grenada autonomy over its
internal affairs. Full independence was attained in 1974, making
Grenada one of the smallest independent countries in the Western
Hemisphere. In 1979, a leftist New Jewel Movement seized power
under Maurice BISHOP, ushering in the Grenada Revolution. On 19
October 1983, factions within the revolutionary government
overthrew and killed BISHOP and members of his party. Six days
later, the island was invaded by US forces and those of six other
Caribbean nations, which quickly captured the ringleaders and their
hundreds of Cuban advisers. The rule of law was restored, and
democratic elections were reinstituted the following year and have
continued since then.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: the telecom sector has seen
a decline in subscriber numbers (particularly for prepaid mobile
services the mainstay of short term visitors) and revenue; fixed
and mobile broadband services are two areas that have benefited
from the crisis as employees and students have resorted to working
from home; one area of the telecom market that is not prepared for
growth is 5G mobile; governments, regulators, and even the mobile
network operators have shown that they have not been investing in
5G opportunities at the present time; network expansion and
enhancements remain concentrated around improving LTE coverage

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
