   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">From the late 14th to the mid 19th century a Kingdom of Kongo
stretched across central Africa from present-day northern Angola
into the current Congo republics. It traded heavily with the
Portuguese who, beginning in the 16th century, established coastal
colonies and trading posts and introduced Christianity. By the 19th
century, Portuguese settlement had spread to the interior; in 1914,
Portugal abolished the last vestiges of the Kongo Kingdom and
Angola became a Portuguese colony.<br/>
         <br/>
Angola scores low on human development indexes despite using its
large oil reserves to rebuild since the end of a 27-year civil war
in 2002. Fighting between the Popular Movement for the Liberation
of Angola (MPLA), led by Jose Eduardo DOS SANTOS, and the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), led by Jonas
SAVIMBI, followed independence from Portugal in 1975. Peace seemed
imminent in 1992 when Angola held national elections, but fighting
picked up again in 1993. Up to 1.5 million lives may have been lost
- and 4 million people displaced - during the more than a quarter
century of fighting. SAVIMBI's death in 2002 ended UNITA's
insurgency and cemented the MPLA's hold on power. DOS SANTOS
stepped down from the presidency in 2017, having led the country
since 1979. He pushed through a new constitution in 2010. Joao
LOURENCO was elected president in August 2017 and became president
of the MPLA in September 2018.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">More than two decades after the end of Angola's 27-year civil
war, the country still faces a variety of socioeconomic problems,
including poverty, high maternal and child mortality, and
illiteracy. Despite the country's rapid post-war economic growth
based on oil production, about 30 percent of Angolans live below
the poverty line and unemployment is widespread, especially among
the large young-adult population. Only about 70% of the population
is literate, and the rate drops to around 60% for women. The
youthful population - about 48% are under the age of 15 as of 2022
- is expected to continue growing rapidly with a fertility rate of
more than 5 children per woman and a low rate of contraceptive use.
Fewer than half of women deliver their babies with the assistance
of trained health care personnel, which contributes to Angola's
high maternal mortality rate.Of the estimated 550,000 Angolans who fled their homeland during
its civil war, most have returned home since 2002. In 2012, the UN
assessed that conditions in Angola had been stable for several
years and invoked a cessation of refugee status for Angolans.
Following the cessation clause, some of those still in exile
returned home voluntarily through UN repatriation programs, and
others integrated into host countries.</subsection>

recent years has benefited from political stability, which has
encouraged foreign investment in the sector; the government and
regulator have also set in train mechanisms to open up the telecom
sector to new competitors, mobile services were launched in April
2022; the MNOs were slow to develop LTE services, instead relying
on their GSM and 3G network capabilities; there has been slow
progress in LTE network development, with only a small proportion
of the country covered by network infrastructure; the Ministry of
Telecommunications in early 2021 set up a 5G hub to assess 5G user
cases; the regulator in November 2021 granted licenses to various
companies offering 5G services, with spectrum in the 3.3-3.7GHz
range having been set aside for such services (2022)<br/>

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
