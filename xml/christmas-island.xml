   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Although Europeans sighted the island as early as 1615, it was
only named in 1643 by English Captain William MYNORS for the day of
its rediscovery. Another English ship sailed by the island in 1688
and found it uninhabited. Attempts to explore the island over the
next two centuries were hampered by steep cliffs and dense jungle.
Phosphate discovery on the island in 1887, lead to the UK annexing
it the following year. In 1898, the Christmas Island Phosphate
Company brought in 200 Chinese indentured servants to work the
mines, along with Malays, Sikhs, and a small number of Europeans.
The UK administered Christmas Island from Singapore.<br/>
         <br/>
Japan invaded the island in 1942, but islanders sabotaged Japanese
mining operations, making the mines relatively unproductive. After
World War II, Australia and New Zealand bought the Christmas Island
Phosphate Company, and in 1958, the UK transferred sovereignty from
Singapore to Australia in exchange for $20 million for the loss of
future phosphate income. In 1980, Australia set up the Christmas
Island National Park and expanded its boundaries throughout the
1980s until it covered more than 60% of the islandâ€™s territory. The
phosphate mine was closed in 1987 because of environmental concerns
and Australia has rejected several efforts to reopen it.<br/>
         <br/>
In the 1980s, boats of asylum seekers started landing on Christmas
Island and the migrants claimed refugee status since they were on
Australian territory. In 2001, Australia declared Christmas Island
outside the Australian migration zone and built an immigration
detention center on the island. Completed in 2008, the
controversial detention center was officially closed in 2018, but
then reopened in early 2019. In 2020, the center served as a
coronavirus quarantine facility for Australian citizens evacuated
from China.</subsection>
