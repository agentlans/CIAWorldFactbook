   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The landlocked West Bank - the larger of the two Palestinian
territories - is home to some three million Palestinians. Inhabited
since at least the 15th century B.C., the West Bank has been
dominated by many different peoples throughout its history; it was
incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in the early 16th century. The
West Bank fell to British forces during World War I, becoming part
of the British Mandate of Palestine. Following the 1948
Arab-Israeli War, the West Bank was captured by Transjordan (later
renamed Jordan), which annexed the West Bank in 1950; it was
captured by Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967. Under a series of
agreements known as the Oslo Accords signed between 1993 and 1999,
Israel transferred to the newly created Palestinian Authority (PA)
security and civilian responsibility for many Palestinian-populated
areas of the West Bank as well as the Gaza Strip.In addition to establishing the PA as an interim government, the
Oslo Accords divided the West Bank into three areas with one fully
managed by the PA, another fully administered by Israel, and a
third with shared control until a permanent agreement could be
reached between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and
Israel. In 2000, a violent intifada or uprising began across the
Palestinian territories, and in 2001 negotiations for a permanent
agreement between the PLO and Israel on final status issues
stalled. Subsequent attempts to re-start direct negotiations have
not resulted in progress toward determining final status of the
area.The PA last held national elections in 2006, when the Islamic
Resistance Movement (HAMAS) won a majority of seats in the
Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC). Fatah, the dominant
Palestinian political faction in the West Bank, and HAMAS failed to
maintain a unity government, leading to violent clashes between
their respective supporters and HAMAS’s violent seizure of all PA
military and governmental institutions in the Gaza Strip in June
2007. In December 2018, the Palestinian Constitutional Court
dissolved the PLC. In recent years, Fatah and HAMAS have made
several attempts at reconciliation, but the factions have been
unable to implement agreements. </subsection>
