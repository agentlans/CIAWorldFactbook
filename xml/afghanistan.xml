   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Ahmad Shah DURRANI unified the Pashtun tribes and founded
Afghanistan in 1747. The country served as a buffer between the
British and Russian Empires until it won independence from notional
British control in 1919. A brief experiment in increased democracy
ended in a 1973 coup and a 1978 communist countercoup. The Soviet
Union invaded in 1979 to support the tottering Afghan communist
regime, touching off a long and destructive war. The USSR withdrew
in 1989 under relentless pressure by internationally supported
anti-communist mujahidin rebels. A series of subsequent civil wars
saw Kabul finally fall in 1996 to the Taliban, a hardline
Pakistani-sponsored movement that emerged in 1994 to end the
country's civil war and anarchy. Following the 11 September 2001
terrorist attacks, a US, Allied, and anti-Taliban Northern Alliance
military action toppled the Taliban for sheltering Usama BIN
LADIN.A UN-sponsored Bonn Conference in 2001 established a process for
political reconstruction that included the adoption of a new
constitution, a presidential election in 2004, and National
Assembly elections in 2005. In December 2004, Hamid KARZAI became
the first democratically elected president of Afghanistan and was
reelected in August 2009. In February 2020, the US and the Taliban
signed the “US-Taliban Agreement,” which contained commitments by
the US related to the withdrawal from Afghanistan of military
forces of the US, its allies, and Coalition partners, as well as
commitments by the Taliban related to counterterrorism, among other
topics. Following a US drawdown of virtually all of its troops, a
summer 2021 Taliban offensive quickly overran the country and the
Taliban took over Kabul in August of 2021. </subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">the return of the Taliban to power in August 2021 following the American-led withdrawal of security forces has thrown the telecom sector into disarray; Afghanistan was near the bottom of the world’s rankings in terms of its telecom market maturity, but it had been making some positive progress toward establishing widespread coverage over the prior decade under civilian administration; after the first Taliban regime was toppled in 2001, considerable foreign investment along with open competition in the telecom sector resulted in the transformation of the mobile market; the first mobile network was set up in 2002, and by 2020 coverage had reached 90%; mobile penetration rates, too, had climbed from zero to almost 100% by the time a new insurgency kicked off in 2019 that was closely followed by the start of the Covid-19 pandemic; both events caused a drop in subscriber numbers and in revenue for the mobile operators; it was additional costs involved with repairing and replacing network infrastructure destroyed by the Taliban in the build up to their takeover that put a strain on the operators’ finances; with increased levels of risk and uncertainty now associated with running a telecom company in the embattled state (2021)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>

2021, the former Afghan Government-owned broadcaster, Radio
Television Afghanistan (RTA), operated a series of radio and
television stations in Kabul and the provinces and the country had
an estimated 174 private radio stations and 83 TV stations;
television and radio are key media platforms; only about a fifth of
Afghans in urban areas use the internet, mostly through

         <note title="tier rating"/>Tier 3 — Afghanistan does not fully meet the minimum standards
for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant
efforts to do so; therefore, Afghanistan remains on Tier 3;
substantial personnel turnover and closing of some ministries after
the August 15, 2021 Taliban takeover hindered Afghanistan’s ability
to maintain consistent anti-trafficking efforts; although the
pre-August 15 government took some training and awareness steps to
address trafficking, it employed or recruited child soldiers and
sexual slaves in government compounds; after August 15, the Taliban
continued recruiting or employing child soldiers and did not
investigate, prosecute, or convict any traffickers; the Taliban
shut down shelters for victims, did not identify or protect
victims, and did not make any efforts to prevent trafficking;
Taliban undermining the rights of women, minorities, and other
vulnerable populations, further exacerbated vulnerabilities to
trafficking (2022)<note title="trafficking profile">human traffickers exploit domestic and foreign victims in Afghanistan and exploit Afghan victims abroad; internal trafficking is more prevalent than transnational trafficking; since the Taliban takeover, vulnerabilities to exploitation have intensified; traffickers exploit men, women, and a large number of children domestically; victims are subjected to forced labor in agriculture, brick kilns, carpet weaving, domestic servitude, commercial sex, begging, poppy cultivation and harvesting, salt mining, transnational drug smuggling, and truck driving; the Taliban and non-state armed groups, such as the Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISIS-K), continue to unlawfully recruit and use child soldiers; sexual exploitation of boys remains pervasive nationwide, and traffickers subject some boys to sexual exploitation abroad; after the Taliban takeover, restrictions on the movement of women and girls, and severely diminished access to employment and education, increased their vulnerability to trafficking; LGBTQI+ individuals are among the most vulnerable groups in Afghanistan under the Taliban (2022)</note>
         <note title="note">The United States has not recognized the Taliban or another entity as the government of Afghanistan. On August 15, 2021, the Taliban culminated its takeover of Kabul, and on September 7, 2021, the Taliban announced a so-called interim government. As of December 2021, the Taliban had not outlined steps or a timeline to establish a new permanent government. All references to “the pre-August 15 government” refer to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. References to the Taliban reflect events both prior to and after August 15.</note>
