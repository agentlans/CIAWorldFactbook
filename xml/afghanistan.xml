   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Ahmad Shah DURRANI unified the Pashtun tribes and founded
Afghanistan in 1747. The country served as a buffer between the
British and Russian Empires until it won independence from notional
British control in 1919. A brief experiment in increased democracy
ended in a 1973 coup and a 1978 communist countercoup. The Soviet
Union invaded in 1979 to support the tottering Afghan communist
regime, touching off a long and destructive war. The USSR withdrew
in 1989 under relentless pressure by internationally supported
anti-communist mujahidin rebels. A series of subsequent civil wars
saw Kabul finally fall in 1996 to the Taliban, a hardline
Pakistani-sponsored movement that emerged in 1994 to end the
country's civil war and anarchy. Following the 11 September 2001
terrorist attacks, a US, Allied, and anti-Taliban Northern Alliance
military action toppled the Taliban for sheltering Usama BIN
LADIN.A UN-sponsored Bonn Conference in 2001 established a process for
political reconstruction that included the adoption of a new
constitution, a presidential election in 2004, and National
Assembly elections in 2005. In December 2004, Hamid KARZAI became
the first democratically elected president of Afghanistan and was
reelected in August 2009. In February 2020, the US and the Taliban
signed the “US-Taliban Agreement,” which contained commitments by
the US related to the withdrawal from Afghanistan of military
forces of the US, its allies, and Coalition partners, as well as
commitments by the Taliban related to counterterrorism, among other
topics. Following a US drawdown of virtually all of its troops, a
summer 2021 Taliban offensive quickly overran the country and the
Taliban took over Kabul in August of 2021. </subsection>

      <subsection title="Flag description">three equal vertical bands of black (hoist side), red, and
green, with the national emblem in white centered on the red band
and slightly overlapping the other 2 bands; the center of the
emblem features a mosque with pulpit and flags on either side,
below the mosque are Eastern Arabic numerals for the solar year
1298 (1919 in the Gregorian calendar, the year of Afghan
independence from the UK); this central image is circled by a
border consisting of sheaves of wheat on the left and right, in the
upper-center is an Arabic inscription of the Shahada (Muslim creed)
below which are rays of the rising sun over the Takbir (Arabic
expression meaning "God is great"), and at bottom center is a
scroll bearing the name Afghanistan; black signifies the past, red
is for the blood shed for independence, and green can represent
either hope for the future, agricultural prosperity, or Islam<br/>

note 1: the United States has not recognized the
Taliban or any other entity as the government of Afghanistan and,
accordingly, continues to display the flag of Afghanistan as set
forth in the country's constitution of 2004<br/>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: the return of the Taliban
to power in August 2021 following the American-led withdrawal of
security forces has thrown the telecom sector into disarray;
Afghanistan was near the bottom of the world’s rankings in terms of
its telecom market maturity, but it had been making some positive
progress toward establishing widespread coverage over the prior
decade under civilian administration; after the first Taliban
regime was toppled in 2001, considerable foreign investment along
with open competition in the telecom sector resulted in the
transformation of the mobile market; the first mobile network was
set up in 2002, and by 2020 coverage had reached 90%; mobile
penetration rates, too, had climbed from zero to almost 100% by the
time a new insurgency kicked off in 2019 that was closely followed
by the start of the Covid-19 pandemic; both events caused a drop in
subscriber numbers and in revenue for the mobile operators; it was
additional costs involved with repairing and replacing network
infrastructure destroyed by the Taliban in the build up to their
takeover that put a strain on the operators’ finances; with
increased levels of risk and uncertainty now associated with
running a telecom company in the embattled state (2021)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: before 15 August 2021, less than 1 per
100 for fixed-line teledensity; 58 per 100 for mobile-cellular; an
increasing number of Afghans utilize mobile-cellular phone networks
(2021)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 93; multiple
VSAT's provide international and domestic voice and data
connectivity (2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
      <subsection title="Broadcast media">since 15 August 2021, independent media outlets have decreased
in number due to financial hardships, departure of staff from the
country, and restrictions placed by the Taliban; media workers
report self-censoring criticism of the Taliban; before 15 August
2021, the former Afghan Government-owned broadcaster, Radio
Television Afghanistan (RTA), operated a series of radio and
television stations in Kabul and the provinces and the country had
an estimated 174 private radio stations and 83 TV stations;
television and radio are key media platforms; only about a fifth of
Afghans in urban areas use the internet, mostly through
smartphones, and young adults are significantly more likely to use
the internet (2021)</subsection>

      <subsection title="Trafficking in persons">tier rating:Tier 3 — Afghanistan does not fully meet the minimum standards
for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant
efforts to do so; therefore, Afghanistan remains on Tier 3;
substantial personnel turnover and closing of some ministries after
the August 15, 2021 Taliban takeover hindered Afghanistan’s ability
to maintain consistent anti-trafficking efforts; although the
pre-August 15 government took some training and awareness steps to
address trafficking, it employed or recruited child soldiers and
sexual slaves in government compounds; after August 15, the Taliban
continued recruiting or employing child soldiers and did not
investigate, prosecute, or convict any traffickers; the Taliban
shut down shelters for victims, did not identify or protect
victims, and did not make any efforts to prevent trafficking;
Taliban undermining the rights of women, minorities, and other
vulnerable populations, further exacerbated vulnerabilities to
trafficking (2022)<br/>
