   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Principality of Liechtenstein was established within the
Holy Roman Empire in 1719. Occupied by both French and Russian
troops during the Napoleonic Wars, it became a sovereign state in
1806 and joined the German Confederation in 1815. Liechtenstein
became fully independent in 1866 when the Confederation dissolved.
Until the end of World War I, it was closely tied to Austria, but
the economic devastation caused by that conflict forced
Liechtenstein to enter into a customs and monetary union with
Switzerland. Since World War II (in which Liechtenstein remained
neutral), the country's low taxes have spurred outstanding economic
growth. In 2000, shortcomings in banking regulatory oversight
resulted in concerns about the use of financial institutions for
money laundering. However, Liechtenstein implemented anti-money
laundering legislation and a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with
the US that went into effect in 2003.</subsection>
