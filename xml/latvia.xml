   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Several eastern Baltic tribes merged in medieval times to form
the ethnic core of the Latvian people (ca. 8th-12th centuries
A.D.). The region subsequently came under the control of Germans,
Poles, Swedes, and finally, Russians. A Latvian republic emerged
following World War I, but it was annexed by the USSR in 1940 - an
action never recognized by the US and many other countries. Latvia
reestablished its independence in 1991 following the breakup of the
Soviet Union. Although the last Russian troops left in 1994, the
status of the Russian minority (some 25% of the population) remains
of concern to Moscow. Latvia acceded to both NATO and the EU in the
spring of 2004; it joined the euro zone in 2014 and the OECD in
2016. A dual citizenship law was adopted in 2013, easing
naturalization for non-citizen children.</subsection>
