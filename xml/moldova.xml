   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">A large portion of present day Moldovan territory became a
province of the Russian Empire in 1812 and then unified with
Romania in 1918 in the aftermath of World War I. This territory was
then incorporated into the Soviet Union at the close of World War
II. Although Moldova has been independent from the Soviet Union
since 1991, Russian forces have remained on Moldovan territory east
of the Nistru River in the breakaway region of Transnistria.Years of Communist Party rule in Moldova from 2001-09 ultimately
ended with election-related violent protests and a rerun of
parliamentary elections in 2009. A series of pro-Europe ruling
coalitions governed Moldova from 2010-19, but pro-Russia Igor DODON
won the presidency in 2016 and his Socialist Party of the Republic
of Moldova won a plurality in the legislative election in 2019.
Pro-EU reformist candidate Maia SANDU defeated DODON in his
reelection bid in November 2020 and the Party of Action and
Solidarity, which SANDU founded in 2015, won a parliamentary
majority in an early legislative election in July 2021. Prime
Minister Natalia GAVRILITA and her cabinet took office in August
2021. </subsection>

      <subsection title="Flag description">three equal vertical bands of Prussian blue (hoist side), chrome
yellow, and vermilion red; emblem in center of flag is of a Roman
eagle of dark gold (brown) outlined in black with a red beak and
talons carrying a yellow cross in its beak and a green olive branch
in its right talons and a yellow scepter in its left talons; on its
breast is a shield divided horizontally red over blue with a
stylized aurochs head, star, rose, and crescent all in
black-outlined yellow; based on the color scheme of the flag of
Romania - with which Moldova shares a history and culture - but
Moldova's blue band is lighter; the reverse of the flag displays a
mirrored image of the coat of arms<br/>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: the telecom market has been
affected by a combination of high unemployment and economic
difficulties which have led to constraints on consumer spending;
this has resulted in telecom revenue having fallen steadily in
recent years; this decline continued into 2020, with a 6.3% in
revenue from the important mobile sector alone, year-on-year;
Moldova’s aspirations to join the EU have encouraged the government
and regulator to adopt a range of measures to bring the country’s
telecoms sector into line with EU principles and standards; in July
2017 the Electronic Communications Act was amended to accommodate
the 2009 European regulatory framework, while further amendments
were adopted in December 2017 and additional changes were proposed
in 2019; Moldova is also part of the Eastern Partnership group of
countries, and as such has set in train a glide path to reducing
roaming charges, effective between 2022 and 2026; the country’s
broadband strategy through to 2025 has been supported by the ITU
and industry counterparts from South Korea; the internet market is
developing rapidly; the market is highly competitive, with 101
active ISPs as of early 2021; the number of cable broadband
subscribers is increasing steadily, though fiber is now by far the
strongest sector; by the end of 2020 fiber accounted for about
72.3% of all fixed broadband connections; the mobile market has
also grown rapidly; the near comprehensive geographical reach of
their mobile networks, market brand recognition and existing
customer relationships will make for steady subscriber growth in
coming years (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: competition among mobile telephone
providers has spurred subscriptions; little interest in expanding
fixed-line service which is roughly 25 per 100; mobile-cellular
teledensity nearly 85 per 100 persons (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 373; service through
Romania and Russia via landline; satellite earth stations - at
least 3 - Intelsat, Eutelsat, and Intersputnik<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
