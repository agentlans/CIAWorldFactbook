   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Austronesians settled Fiji around 1000 B.C., followed by
successive waves of Melanesians starting around the first century
A.D. Fijians traded with Polynesian groups in Samoa and Tonga, and
by about 900, much of Fiji was in the Tu’i Tongan Empire’s sphere
of influence. The Tongan influence declined significantly by 1200,
while Melanesian seafarers continued to periodically arrive in
Fiji, further mixing Melanesian and Polynesian cultural traditions.
Dutch explorer Abel TASMAN was the first European to spot Fiji in
1643, followed by British explorer James COOK in 1774. Captain
William BLIGH plotted the islands in 1789. In the 1800s, merchants,
traders, and whalers frequented the islands and the first
missionaries arrived in 1835. Rival kings and chiefs competed for
power, at times aided by Europeans and their weapons, and in 1865,
Seru Epenisa CAKOBAU united many groups into the Confederacy of
Independent Kingdoms of Viti. The arrangement proved weak and in
1871 CAKOBAU formed the Kingdom of Fiji in an attempt to centralize
power. Fearing a hostile takeover by a foreign power as the
kingdom’s economy began to falter, CAKOBAU ceded Fiji to the UK in
1874.<br/>
         <br/>
The first British governor set up a plantation-style economy and
brought in more than 60,000 Indians as indentured laborers, most of
whom chose to stay in Fiji rather than return to India when their
contracts expired. In the early 1900s, society was divided along
ethnic lines, with iTaukei (indigenous Fijians), Europeans, and
Indo-Fijians living in separate areas and maintaining their own
languages and traditions. ITaukei fears of an Indo-Fijian takeover
of government delayed independence through the 1960s; Fiji achieved
independence in 1970 with agreements in place to allocate
parliamentary seats by ethnic groups. Long-serving Prime Minister
Kamisese MARA largely balanced these ethnic divisions, but concerns
about growing Indo-Fijian political influence led to two coups in
1987. A new constitution in 1990 cemented iTaukei control of
politics, leading thousands of Indo-Fijians to leave. A reformed
constitution in 1997 was more equitable and led to the election of
an Indo-Fijian prime minister in 1999, who was ousted in a coup the
following year. In 2005, the new prime minister put forward a bill
that would grant pardons to the coup perpetrators, leading
Commodore Josaia BAINIMARAMA to launch a coup in 2006. BAINIMARAMA
 appointed himself prime minister in 2007 and continues to
hold the position after elections in 2014 and 2018 that
international observers deemed credible.<br/>

With well-developed infrastructure, Fiji has become a hub for the
Pacific, hosting the secretariat for the Pacific Islands Forum and
the main campus of the University of the South Pacific. In
addition, Fiji is a center for Pacific tourism, and Nadi
International Airport is by far the busiest airport in a Pacific
island country.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Fiji is the leading market
to watch in terms of both LTE and 5G development in the region; the
market boasts relatively sophisticated, advanced digital
infrastructure, with telcos’ heavy investment resulting in the
country having the highest mobile and internet subscriptions in the
Pacific Islands region; LTE, LTE-A, and fiber technologies have
received the most investment by the Fijian mobile operators, LTE
now accounts for the largest share of connections in the mobile
segment; concentrating on the more highly populated areas, the
operators are preparing for the next growth area of high-speed
data; they also have 5G in mind, and are preparing their networks
to be 5G-ready, anticipating an easier migration to the technology
based on the relatively high LTE subscription rate; Fiji presents a
challenging geographic environment for infrastructure development
due to its population being spread across more than 100 islands;
the majority of Fijians live on the two main islands of Viti Levu
and Vanua Levu; in July 2018, the two islands were linked by the
Savusavu submarine cable system, which provides a more secure link
in times of emergency weather events such as the regular tropical
cyclones that often cause massive destruction to the area,
including destroying essential infrastructure such as electricity
and telecommunications equipment; notably, the December 2021
eruption of the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai submarine volcano in
Tonga damaged the Tonga Cable which connects Fiji, and Tonga
blocking the latter off from internet services; cable theft and
damage of critical communications infrastructure has also become a
concern in Fiji, prompting authorities to establish a joint task
force to tackle the issue (2022)<br/>

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
