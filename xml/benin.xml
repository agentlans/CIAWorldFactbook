   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Present day Benin is comprised of about 42 ethnic groups,
including the Yoruba in the southeast, who migrated from what is
now Nigeria in the 12th century; the Dendi in the north-central
area, who came from Mali in the 16th century; the Bariba and the
Fula in the northeast; the Ottamari in the Atakora mountains; the
Fon in the area around Abomey in the south-central area; and the
Mina, Xueda, and Aja, who came from Togo, on the coast. The Kingdom
of Dahomey emerged on the Abomey plateau in the 17th century and
was a regional power for much of the 18th and 19th centuries.
Dahomey had an organized domestic economy, international trade with
Europeans, and a highly organized military. The growth of Dahomey
coincided with the growth of the Atlantic slave trade, and it
became known as a major source of enslaved people. France began to
control the coastal areas of Dahomey in the second half of the 19th
century; the entire kingdom was conquered by 1894. French Dahomey
achieved independence in 1960; it changed its name to the Republic
of Benin in 1975.

A succession of military governments ended in 1972 with the rise to
power of Mathieu KEREKOU and the establishment of a government
based on Marxist-Leninist principles. A move to representative
government began in 1989. Two years later, free elections ushered
in former Prime Minister Nicephore SOGLO as president, marking the
first successful transfer of power in Africa from a dictatorship to
a democracy. KEREKOU was returned to power by elections held in
1996 and 2001, though some irregularities were alleged. KEREKOU
stepped down at the end of his second term in 2006 and was
succeeded by Thomas YAYI Boni, a political outsider and
independent, who won a second five-year term in March 2011. Patrice
TALON, a wealthy businessman, took office in 2016; the space for
pluralism, dissent, and free expression has narrowed under his
administration. TALON won a second term in April 2021.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Benin has a youthful age structure – almost 65% of the
population is under the age of 25 as of 2022 – which is bolstered
by high fertility and population growth rates. Benin’s total
fertility has been falling over time but remains high, declining
from almost 7 children per women in 1990 to 5.4 in 2022. Benin’s
low contraceptive use and high unmet need for contraception
contribute to the sustained high fertility rate. Although the
majority of Beninese women use skilled health care personnel for
antenatal care and delivery, the high rate of maternal mortality
indicates the need for more access to high quality obstetric
care.Poverty, unemployment, increased living costs, and dwindling
resources increasingly drive the Beninese to migrate. An estimated
4.4 million, more than 30%, of Beninese live abroad. Virtually all
Beninese emigrants move to West African countries, particularly
Nigeria and Cote d’Ivoire. Of the less than 1% of Beninese
emigrants who settle in Europe, the vast majority live in France,
Benin’s former colonial ruler.With about 40% of the population living below the poverty line
as of 2019, many desperate parents resort to sending their children
to work in wealthy households as domestic servants (a common
practice known as vidomegon), mines, quarries, or agriculture
domestically or in Nigeria and other neighboring countries, often
under brutal conditions. Unlike in other West African countries,
where rural people move to the coast, farmers from Benin’s densely
populated southern and northwestern regions move to the
historically sparsely populated central region to pursue
agriculture. Immigrants from West African countries came to Benin
in increasing numbers between 1992 and 2002 because of its
political stability and porous borders.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">Benin’s telecom market continues to be restricted by the poor condition of the country’s fixed-line infrastructure; this has hampered the development of fixed-line voice and internet services, and there is negligible revenue derived from these sectors; mobile networks account for almost all internet connections, and also carry most voice traffic; there is promise for considerable change in the mobile sector; slow progress is being made in developing competition in the mobile sector; in May 2021 the government sought foreign companies to bid for a fourth mobile license; improved international internet connectivity has contributed to a reduction in end-user pricing, and provided the potential to transform many areas of the country’s economy, bringing a greater proportion of the population into the orbit of internet commerce and connectivity; a 2,000km fiber project started in 2016 was finally completed in mid-2021, prompting the government to secure a loan to build additional fiber infrastructure connecting four of the country’s 12 departments (2022)</note>

      <subsection title="Military - note">a key focus for the security forces of Benin is countering
infiltrations into the country by terrorist groups tied to
al-Qa'ida and the Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS)
operating just over the border from north Benin in Burkina Faso and
Niger; in May 2022, the Benin Government said it was "at war" after
suffering a series of attacks from these groups; later that same
year, President TALON said his government would spend more than
$130 million to recruit up to 4,000 additional military personnel,
modernize military equipment, and build and fortify operating
bases; in addition, the FAB participates in the Multinational Joint
Task Force (MNJTF) along with Cameroon, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria
against Boko Haram and other terrorist groups operating in the
general area of the Lake Chad Basin and along Nigeria's northeast
border

the FAB has a close working relationship with the Belgian armed
forces; the Belgians offer military advice, training, and
second-hand equipment donations, and deploy to Benin for limited
military exercises (2023)</subsection>
      <subsection title="Maritime threats">the International Maritime Bureau reports the territorial and
offshore waters in the Niger Delta and Gulf of Guinea remain a very
high risk for piracy and armed robbery of ships; in 2021, there
were 34 reported incidents of piracy and armed robbery at sea in
the Gulf of Guinea region; although a significant decrease from the
total number of 81 incidents in 2020, it included the one hijacking
and three of five ships fired upon worldwide; while boarding and
attempted boarding to steal valuables from ships and crews are the
most common types of incidents, almost a third of all incidents
involve a hijacking and/or kidnapping; in 2021, 57 crew members
were kidnapped in seven separate incidents in the Gulf of Guinea,
representing 100% of kidnappings worldwide; Nigerian pirates in
particular are well armed and very aggressive, operating as far as
200 nm offshore; the Maritime Administration of the US Department
of Transportation has issued a Maritime Advisory (2022-001 - Gulf
of Guinea-Piracy/Armed Robbery/Kidnapping for Ransom) effective 4
January 2022, which states in part, "Piracy, armed robbery, and
kidnapping for ransom continue to serve as significant threats to
US-flagged vessels transiting or operating in the Gulf of
Guinea"</subsection>
