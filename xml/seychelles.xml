   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Seychelles was uninhabited prior to being discovered by
Europeans early in the 16th century. A lengthy struggle between
France and Great Britain for the islands ended in 1814, when they
were ceded to the latter. During colonial rule, a plantation-based
economy developed that relied on imported labor, primarily from
European colonies in Africa. Independence came in 1976. Following a
coup d’etat in 1977, the country was a socialist one-party state
until adopting a new constitution and holding free elections in
1993. President France-Albert RENE, who had served since 1977, was
reelected in 2001, but stepped down in 2004. Vice President James
Alix MICHEL took over the presidency and in 2006 was elected to a
new five-year term; he was reelected in 2011 and again in 2015. In
2016, James MICHEL resigned and handed over the presidency to his
vice-president, Danny FAURE. In 2020, Wavel RAMKALAWAN was elected
president, the first time an opposition candidate has won the
presidency since independence.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Seychelles has no indigenous population and was first
permanently settled by a small group of French planters, African
slaves, and South Indians in 1770. Seychelles’ modern population is
composed of the descendants of French and later British settlers,
Africans, and Indian, Chinese, and Middle Eastern traders and is
concentrated on three of its 155 islands – the vast majority on
Mahe and lesser numbers on Praslin and La Digue. Seychelles’
population grew rapidly during the second half of the 20th century,
largely due to natural increase, but the pace has slowed because of
fertility decline. The total fertility rate dropped sharply from
4.0 children per woman in 1980 to 1.9 in 2015, mainly as a result
of a family planning program, free education and health care, and
increased female labor force participation. Life expectancy has
increased steadily, but women on average live 9 years longer than
men, a difference that is higher than that typical of developed
countries.The combination of reduced fertility and increased longevity has
resulted in an aging population, which will put pressure on the
government’s provision of pensions and health care. Seychelles’
sustained investment in social welfare services, such as free
primary health care and education up to the post-secondary level,
have enabled the country to achieve a high human development index
score – among the highest in Africa. Despite some of its health and
education indicators being nearly on par with Western countries,
Seychelles has a high level of income inequality.An increasing number of migrant workers – mainly young men –
have been coming to Seychelles in recent years to work in the
construction and tourism industries. As of 2011, foreign workers
made up nearly a quarter of the workforce. Indians are the largest
non-Seychellois population – representing half of the country’s
foreigners – followed by Malagasy.</subsection>
