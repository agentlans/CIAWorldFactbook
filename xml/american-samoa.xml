   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Tutuila was settled by 1000 B.C. and the island served as a
refuge for exiled chiefs and defeated warriors from the other
Samoan islands. The Manu’a Islands developed its own traditional
chiefdom that maintained its autonomy by controlling oceanic trade.
In 1722, Dutch explorer Jacob ROGGEVEEN was the first European to
sail through the Manu’a Islands, and he was followed by French
explorer Louis Antoine DE BOUGAINVILLE in 1768. Whalers and
missionaries arrived in American Samoa in the 1830s, but American
and European traders tended to favor the port in Apia - now in
independent Samoa - over the smaller and less-developed Pago Pago
on Tutuila. In the mid-1800s, a dispute arose in Samoa over control
of the Samoan archipelago, with different chiefs gaining support
from Germany, the UK, and the US. In 1872, the high chief of
Tutuila offered the US exclusive rights to Pago Pago in return for
US protection, but the US rejected this offer. As fighting resumed,
the US agreed to the chief’s request in 1878 and set up a coaling
station at Pago Pago. In 1899, with continued disputes over
succession, Germany and the US agreed to divide the Samoan islands,
while the UK withdrew its claims in exchange for parts of the
Solomon Islands. Local chiefs on Tutuila formally ceded their land
to the US in 1900, followed by the chief of Manu’a in 1904. The
territory was officially named “American Samoa” in 1911.

The US administered the territory through the Department of the
Navy, and in 1918, the naval governor instituted strict quarantine
rules to prevent the spread of the Spanish flu, allowing American
Samoa to avoid the deadly infection that ravaged the then-New
Zealand administered territory of Samoa. In 1949, there was an
attempt to organize the territory, granting it formal
self-government, but local chiefs helped defeat the measure in the
US Congress. Administration was transferred to the Department of
the Interior in 1951, and in 1967, American Samoa adopted a
constitution that provides significant protections for traditional
Samoan land tenure rules, language, and culture. In 1977, after
four attempts, voters approved a measure to directly elect their
governor. Nevertheless, American Samoa officially remains an
unorganized territory and people born in American Samoa are US
nationals instead of US citizens, a status many American Samoans
prefer.

         <note title="general assessment">American Samoa Telecommunications Authority, ASTCA, supplies telecommunication services to the residents of the American Samoan islands, a territory of the United States, which are found in a remote area of the Pacific Ocean; the primary system between the islands consists of fiber-optic cables and satellite connections; over Independence Day weekend 2021, the undersea fiber-optic cable linking the Tutuila and Manu’a Islands failed, completely stranding the Manu’a Islands from all telecommunication services; telecommunication services were restored to the people of Manu’a islands through microwave link between Tutuila to the Manu’a Islands; the link is now providing a steady 1Gbps backhaul most of the time of the year with 600Mbps at four 9’s availability, over this extremely long distance (2022)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>
