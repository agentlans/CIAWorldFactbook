   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Ethnic Kazakhs derive from a mix of Turkic nomadic tribes that
migrated to the region in the 15th century. The Kazakh steppe was
conquered by the Russian Empire in the 18th and 19th centuries, and
Kazakhstan became a Soviet Republic in 1925. Repression and
starvation caused by forced agricultural collectivization led to
more than a million deaths in the early 1930s. During the 1950s and
1960s, the agricultural "Virgin Lands" program led to an influx of
settlers (mostly ethnic Russians, but also other nationalities) and
at the time of Kazakhstan’s independence in 1991, ethnic Kazakhs
were a minority. Non-Muslim ethnic minorities departed Kazakhstan
in large numbers from the mid-1990s through the mid-2000s and a
national program has repatriated about a million ethnic Kazakhs
(from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Mongolia, and the Xinjiang region of
China) back to Kazakhstan. As a result of this shift, the ethnic
Kazakh share of the population now exceeds two-thirds.

Kazakhstan's economy is the largest in Central Asia, mainly due to
the country's vast natural resources. Current issues include:
diversifying the economy, attracting foreign direct investment,
enhancing Kazakhstan's economic competitiveness, and strengthening
economic relations with neighboring states and foreign powers. </subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Nearly 40% of Kazakhstan’s population is under the age of
25.  Like many former Soviet states, Kazakhstan’s total
fertility rate (TFR) – the average number of births per woman –
decreased after independence amidst economic problems and fell
below replacement level, 2.1.  However, in the late 2000s, as
the economy improved and incomes rose, Kazakhstan experienced a
small baby boom and TFR reached 2.5.  TFR has since fallen and
is now just over 2.1.  Mortality rates are also decreasing and
life expectancy is rising, signs that Kazakhstan’s demographic
transition is progressing. Kazakhstan has a diverse population consisting of Asian ethnic
groups (predominantly Kazakhs, as well as Uzbeks, Uighurs, and
Tatars) and ethnic Europeans (mainly Russians but also Ukrainians
and Germans).  Approximately two thirds of Kazakhstan’s
population today is Kazakh.  During the mid-20th
century, as Kazakhstan industrialized, waves of ethnic Russians and
deportees from other parts of the Soviet Union arrived. 
Eventually, the ethnic Russian population outnumbered the Kazakhs.
 In the 1990s, following Kazakhstan’s independence, Russian
and other ethnic Europeans began emigrating, while some ethnic
Kazakhs (referred to as Oralmans) returned to their homeland from
neighboring countries, China, and Mongolia.  As a result, the
country’s ethnic make-up changed, and a Kazakh majority was
reestablished.In recent years, Kazakhstan has shifted from being mainly a
migrant-sending country to a migrant-receiving country.  Due
to its oil-driven economic boom, Kazakhstan has become a more
popular destination.  The country needs highly skilled workers
in the industrial, business, and education sectors and low-skilled
labor in agriculture, markets, services, and construction. 
Kazakhstan is increasingly reliant on migrant workers, primarily
from Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, to fill its labor
shortage.  At the same time, highly skilled Kazakhs continue
to emigrate, mostly to Russia, seeking higher salaries or further
education.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">Kazakhstan has one of the most developed telecommunications sectors in the Central Asian region; this is especially true of the mobile segment, where widespread network coverage has enabled very high penetration rates reaching 180% as far back as 2012; the mobile and fixed-line segments have both pared back their subscriber numbers to more modest levels; the telcos have still been successful in terms of improving their margins and revenues by growing value-added services along with exploiting the capabilities of their higher speed networks (4G LTE as well as fiber) to drive significant increases in data usage; Kazakhstan has enjoyed a  high fixed-line teledensity thanks to concerted efforts to invest in the fixed-line infrastructure as well as next-generation networks; demand for traditional voice services is on the wane as customers take a preference for the flexibility and ubiquity of the mobile platform for voice as well as data services; mobile clearly dominates the telecom sector in Kazakhstan, yet 2020 saw a sharp drop in subscriber numbers for both mobile voice and mobile broadband services as the Covid-19 crisis took hold; with the exception of fixed-line voice services, Kazakhstan’s telecom market is expected to return to moderate growth from 2022 onward; the extensive deployment of LTE networks across the country (along with the prospect of 5G services being added to the mix in 2023) points towards an even greater uptake of lucrative mobile broadband services, in particular (2021)</note>
         <note title="domestic">intercity by landline and microwave radio relay; number of fixed-line connections is approximately 16 per 100 persons; mobile-cellular subscriber base 129 per 100 persons (2020)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>
