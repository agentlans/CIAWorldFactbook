   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Settled by Norwegian and Celtic (Scottish and Irish) immigrants
during the late 9th and 10th centuries A.D., Iceland boasts the
world's oldest functioning legislative assembly, the Althingi,
established in 930. Independent for over 300 years, Iceland was
subsequently ruled by Norway and Denmark. Fallout from the Askja
volcano of 1875 devastated the Icelandic economy and caused
widespread famine. Over the next quarter century, 20% of the
island's population emigrated, mostly to Canada and the US. Denmark
granted limited home rule in 1874 and complete independence in
1944. The second half of the 20th century saw substantial economic
growth driven primarily by the fishing industry. The economy
diversified greatly after the country joined the European Economic
Area in 1994, but Iceland was especially hard hit by the global
financial crisis in the years following 2008. The economy is now on
an upward trajectory, fueled primarily by a tourism and
construction boom. Literacy, longevity, and social cohesion are
first rate by world standards.</subsection>

hotspot, experiences severe volcanic activity; Eyjafjallajokull
(1,666 m) erupted in 2010, sending ash high into the atmosphere and
seriously disrupting European air traffic; scientists continue to
monitor nearby Katla (1,512 m), which has a high probability of
eruption in the very near future, potentially disrupting air
traffic; Grimsvoetn and Hekla are Iceland's most active volcanoes;
other historically active volcanoes include Askja, Bardarbunga,
Brennisteinsfjoll, Esjufjoll, Hengill, Krafla, Krisuvik,
Kverkfjoll, Oraefajokull, Reykjanes, Torfajokull, and

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Iceland has one of the
smallest yet most progressive telecom markets in Europe; the
country in 2020 became the top in Europe for fiber penetration; it
aims to provide a fixed broadband service of at least 100Mb/s to
99.9% of the population by the end of 2021, an ambitious target by
international standards and one which it is likely to achieve given
the progress which operators have made in extending the reach of
fiber networks; there is effective competition in the mobile and
broadband markets, with a number of players having emerged to
challenge the dominance of the two leading operators which have
interests across the telecom sectors; the telecom market has shown
some resilience in recent years following the significant economic
downturn a decade ago, supported by continuing investment in mobile
and fixed-line broadband infrastructure by operators and well as by
the government’s Telecommunications Fund which is supporting Next
Generation Access networks, particularly in rural areas
(2022)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: 31 per 100 for fixed line and nearing
123 per 100 for mobile-cellular subscriptions (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 354; landing points
for the CANTAT-3, FARICE-1, Greenland Connect and
DANICE submarine cable system that provides connectivity to
Canada, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, UK, Denmark, and
Germany; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (Atlantic
Ocean), 1 Inmarsat (Atlantic and Indian Ocean regions); note -
Iceland shares the Inmarsat earth station with the other Nordic
countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden) (2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
      <subsection title="Broadcast media">state-owned public TV broadcaster (RUV) operates 21 TV channels
nationally (RUV and RUV 2, though RUV 2 is used less
frequently);  RUV broadcasts nationally, every household in
Iceland is required to have RUV as it doubles as the emergency
broadcast network; RUV also operates stringer offices in the north
(Akureyri) and the east (Egilsstadir) but operations are all run
out of RUV headquarters in Reykjavik;  there are 3 privately
owned TV stations;  Stod 2 (Channel 2) is owned by Syn,
following 365 Media and Vodafone merger, and is headquartered in
Reykjavik;  Syn also operates 4 sports channels under Stod
2;  N4 is the only television station headquartered outside of
Reykjavik, in Akureyri, with local programming for the north,
south, and east of Iceland;  Hringbraut is the newest station
and is headquartered in Reykjavik;  all of these television
stations have nationwide penetration as 100% of households have
multi-channel services though digital and/or fiber-optic
connectionsRUV operates 3 radio stations (RAS 1, RAS2, and Rondo) as well
as 4 regional stations (but they mostly act as range extenders for
RUV radio broadcasts nationwide); there is 1 privately owned radio
conglomerate, Syn (4 stations), that broadcasts nationwide, and 3
other radio stations that broadcast to the most densely populated
regions of the country.  In addition, there are upwards of 20
radio stations that operate regionally</subsection>
