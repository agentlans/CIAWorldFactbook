   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Settled by Norwegian and Celtic (Scottish and Irish) immigrants
during the late 9th and 10th centuries A.D., Iceland boasts the
world's oldest functioning legislative assembly, the Althingi,
established in 930. Independent for over 300 years, Iceland was
subsequently ruled by Norway and Denmark. Fallout from the Askja
volcano of 1875 devastated the Icelandic economy and caused
widespread famine. Over the next quarter century, 20% of the
island's population emigrated, mostly to Canada and the US. Denmark
granted limited home rule in 1874 and complete independence in
1944. The second half of the 20th century saw substantial economic
growth driven primarily by the fishing industry. The economy
diversified greatly after the country joined the European Economic
Area in 1994, but Iceland was especially hard hit by the global
financial crisis in the years following 2008. The economy is now on
an upward trajectory, fueled primarily by a tourism and
construction boom. Literacy, longevity, and social cohesion are
first rate by world standards.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">Iceland has one of the smallest yet most progressive telecom markets in Europe; the country in 2020 became the top in Europe for fiber penetration; it aims to provide a fixed broadband service of at least 100Mb/s to 99.9% of the population by the end of 2021, an ambitious target by international standards and one which it is likely to achieve given the progress which operators have made in extending the reach of fiber networks; there is effective competition in the mobile and broadband markets, with a number of players having emerged to challenge the dominance of the two leading operators which have interests across the telecom sectors; the telecom market has shown some resilience in recent years following the significant economic downturn a decade ago, supported by continuing investment in mobile and fixed-line broadband infrastructure by operators and well as by the government’s Telecommunications Fund which is supporting Next Generation Access networks, particularly in rural areas (2022)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>

nationally (RUV and RUV 2, though RUV 2 is used less

broadcast network; RUV also operates stringer offices in the north

out of RUV headquarters in Reykjavik;  there are 3 privately
owned TV stations;  Stod 2 (Channel 2) is owned by Syn,

Reykjavik;  Syn also operates 4 sports channels under Stod
2;  N4 is the only television station headquartered outside of
Reykjavik, in Akureyri, with local programming for the north,

and is headquartered in Reykjavik;  all of these television
stations have nationwide penetration as 100% of households have
multi-channel services though digital and/or fiber-optic
