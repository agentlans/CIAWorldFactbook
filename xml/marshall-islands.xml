   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Humans arrived in the Marshall Islands in the first millennium
B.C. and gradually created permanent settlements on the various
atolls. The early inhabitants were skilled navigators who
frequently traveled between atolls using stick charts to map the
islands. Society became organized under two paramount chiefs, one
each for the Ratak (Sunrise) Chain and the Ralik (Sunset) Chain.
The traditional hierarchy continued even after contact with
Europeans in the early 1500s. Spain formally claimed the islands in
1592, but few other Europeans passed by the islands in the next two
centuries. In 1788, British sea captain John MARSHALL undertook an
exploratory voyage, and the islands were mapped in the early 1800s
by Russian explorers. In the 1850s, US Protestant missionaries
began arriving on the islands. Germany established a supply station
on Jaluit Atoll and bought the islands from Spain in 1884, although
paramount chiefs continued to rule.<br/>
         <br/>
Japan seized the Marshall Islands in 1914 and was granted a League
of Nations Mandate to administer the islands in 1920. Japan built
large military bases throughout the Marshall Islands, and during
World War II, the US captured the bases on Kwajalein, Enewetak, and
Majuro Atolls in Operations Flintlock and Catchpole. The Marshall
Islands came under US administration as part of the Trust Territory
of the Pacific Islands (TTPI) in 1947. Between 1946 and 1958, the
US resettled populations from Bikini and Enewetak Atolls and
conducted 67 nuclear tests; people from Ailinginae and Rongelap
Atolls were also evacuated because of nuclear fallout, and all four
atolls remain largely uninhabited. In 1979, the Marshall Islands
drafted a constitution separate from the rest of the TTPI and
declared independence under President Amata KABUA, a paramount
chief. In 2000, Kessai NOTE became the first commoner elected
president. In 2016, Hilda HEINE was the first woman elected
president.<br/>
         <br/>
In 1982, the Marshall Islands signed a Compact of Free Association
(COFA) with the US, which granted the Marshall Islands financial
assistance and access to many US domestic programs in exchange for
exclusive US military access and defense responsibilities; the COFA
entered into force in 1986 and its funding was renewed in 2003. The
Marshall Islands hosts the US Army Kwajalein Atoll Reagan Missile
Test Site, a key installation in the US missile defense network.
Kwajalein also hosts one of four dedicated ground antennas that
assist in the operation of the Global Positioning System (GPS)
navigation system (the others are at Cape Canaveral, Florida (US),
on Ascension (Saint Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha), and
at Diego Garcia (British Indian Ocean Territory)).</subsection>

Telecommunications Act, through Bill No. 66, ushered in a new era
in telecommunications in the Marshall Islands; this will enable an
open, competitive market for telecommunications that is regulated
by a Telecommunications Commissioner; telecom officials announced
that they would be able to offer satellite internet services
beginning in mid-2023; the World Bank has been promoting
telecommunications reform here for a decade and has a
multi-million-dollar telecommunications reform grant program in
progress (2022)<br/>

domestic: Majuro Atoll and Ebeye and Kwajalein
islands have regular, seven-digit, direct-dial telephones; other
islands interconnected by high frequency radiotelephone (used

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
