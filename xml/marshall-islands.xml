   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Humans arrived in the Marshall Islands in the first millennium
B.C. and gradually created permanent settlements on the various
atolls. The early inhabitants were skilled navigators who
frequently traveled between atolls using stick charts to map the
islands. Society became organized under two paramount chiefs, one
each for the Ratak (Sunrise) Chain and the Ralik (Sunset) Chain.
The traditional hierarchy continued even after contact with
Europeans in the early 1500s. Spain formally claimed the islands in
1592, but few other Europeans passed by the islands in the next two
centuries. In 1788, British sea captain John MARSHALL undertook an
exploratory voyage, and the islands were mapped in the early 1800s
by Russian explorers. In the 1850s, US Protestant missionaries
began arriving on the islands. Germany established a supply station
on Jaluit Atoll and bought the islands from Spain in 1884, although
paramount chiefs continued to rule.

Japan seized the Marshall Islands in 1914 and was granted a League
of Nations Mandate to administer the islands in 1920. Japan built
large military bases throughout the Marshall Islands, and during
World War II, the US captured the bases on Kwajalein, Enewetak, and
Majuro Atolls in Operations Flintlock and Catchpole. The Marshall
Islands came under US administration as part of the Trust Territory
of the Pacific Islands (TTPI) in 1947. Between 1946 and 1958, the
US resettled populations from Bikini and Enewetak Atolls and
conducted 67 nuclear tests; people from Ailinginae and Rongelap
Atolls were also evacuated because of nuclear fallout, and all four
atolls remain largely uninhabited. In 1979, the Marshall Islands
drafted a constitution separate from the rest of the TTPI and
declared independence under President Amata KABUA, a paramount
chief. In 2000, Kessai NOTE became the first commoner elected
president. In 2016, Hilda HEINE was the first woman elected
president.

In 1982, the Marshall Islands signed a Compact of Free Association
(COFA) with the US, which granted the Marshall Islands financial
assistance and access to many US domestic programs in exchange for
exclusive US military access and defense responsibilities; the COFA
entered into force in 1986 and its funding was renewed in 2003. The
Marshall Islands hosts the US Army Kwajalein Atoll Reagan Missile
Test Site, a key installation in the US missile defense network.
Kwajalein also hosts one of four dedicated ground antennas that
assist in the operation of the Global Positioning System (GPS)
navigation system (the others are at Cape Canaveral, Florida (US),
on Ascension (Saint Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha), and
at Diego Garcia (British Indian Ocean Territory)).</subsection>

North Pacific Ocean, about halfway between Hawaii and Australia;
the atolls and islands are situated in two, almost-parallel island
chains - the Ratak (Sunrise) group and the Ralik (Sunset) group;
the total number of islands and islets is about 1,225; 22 of the
atolls and four of the islands are uninhabited</subsection>
