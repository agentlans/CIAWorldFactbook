   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Moorish invasion of Spain in the 8th century and subsequent
incursions into France were finally stemmed at the Pyrenees by
Frankish King Charlemagne, who in 795 created the Hispanic March, a
series of buffer states to keep the Muslim Moors from advancing
into Christian France. The landlocked Principality of Andorra, one
of the smallest states in Europe and nestled high in the Pyrenees
between the French and Spanish borders, is the last independent
survivor of these March states. For 715 years, from 1278 to 1993,
Andorrans lived under a unique coprincipality, ruled by French and
Spanish leaders (from 1607 onward, the French chief of state and
the Bishop of Urgell). In 1993, this feudal system was modified
with the introduction of a modern constitution; the co-princes
remained as titular heads of state, but the government transformed
into a parliamentary democracy.Andorra has become a popular tourist destination visited by
approximately 8 million people each year drawn by the winter
sports, summer climate, and duty-free shopping. Andorra has also
become a wealthy international commercial center because of its
mature banking sector and low taxes. As part of its effort to
modernize its economy, Andorra has opened to foreign investment,
and engaged in other reforms, such as advancing tax initiatives
aimed at supporting a broader infrastructure. Although not a member
of the EU, Andorra enjoys a special relationship with the bloc that
is governed by various customs and cooperation agreements and uses
the euro as its national currency.</subsection>

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
