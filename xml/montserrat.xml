   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">English and Irish colonists from St. Kitts first settled on
Montserrat in 1632; the first African slaves arrived three decades
later. The British and French fought for possession of the island
for most of the 18th century, but it finally was confirmed as a
British possession in 1783. The island's sugar plantation economy
was converted to small farm landholdings in the mid-19th century.
Much of this island was devastated and two thirds of the population
fled abroad because of the eruption of the Soufriere Hills Volcano
that began on 18 July 1995. Montserrat has endured volcanic
activity since, with the last eruption occurring in 2013.</subsection>

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
