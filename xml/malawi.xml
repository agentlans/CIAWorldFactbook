   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Malawi shares its name with the Chewa word for flames and is
linked to the Maravi people from whom the Chewa language
originated. The Maravi settled in what is now Malawi around 1400
during one of the later waves of Bantu migration across central and
southern Africa. Several of Malawi’s ethnic groups trace their
origins to different Maravi lineages. A powerful Maravi kingdom,
established around 1500, reached its zenith around 1700, when it
controlled what is now southern and central Malawi as well as
portions of neighboring Mozambique and Zambia before beginning to
decline because of destabilization from the escalating global trade
in enslaved people. In the early 1800s, widespread conflict in
southern Africa displaced various ethnic Ngoni groups, some of
which moved into Malawi and further undermined the Maravi. Members
of the Yao ethnic group - which had long traded with Malawi from
Mozambique - introduced Islam and began to settle in Malawi in
significant numbers in the mid-1800s; in the late 1800s, members of
the Lomwe ethnic group also moved into southern Malawi from
Mozambique. British missionary and trading activity increased in
the area around Lake Nyasa in the mid-1800s, and Britain declared a
protectorate, called British Central Africa, over what is now
Malawi in 1891 and eliminated various political entities that
sought to retain their autonomy over the subsequent decade. The
British renamed the territory Nyasaland in 1907 and it was part of
the colonial Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland - including
present-day Zambia and Zimbabwe - from 1953 to 1963 before gaining
independence as Malawi in 1964.Hastings Kamuzu BANDA served as prime minister at independence
and, when the country became a republic in 1966, he became
president. He later instituted one-party rule under his Malawi
Congress Party (MCP) and was declared president for life. After
three decades of one-party rule, the country held multiparty
presidential and parliamentary elections in 1994 under a
provisional constitution that came into full effect the following
year. Bakili MULUZI of the United Democratic Front party became the
first freely elected president of Malawi when he defeated BANDA at
the polls in 1994; he won reelection in 1999. President Bingu wa
MUTHARIKA was elected in 2004 and subsequently started his own
party, the Democratic Progressive Party, in 2005. MUTHARIKA was
reelected to a second term in 2009. He died abruptly in 2012 and
was succeeded by Vice President Joyce BANDA, who had earlier
started her own party, the People's Party. MUTHARIKA's brother,
Peter MUTHARIKA, defeated BANDA in the election in 2014. Peter
MUTHARIKA was reelected in a disputed election in 2019 that
resulted in countrywide protests. The courts ordered a new the
election, and in 2020 Lazarus CHAKWERA of the MCP was elected
president after defeating MUTHARIKA as head of a coalition of
opposition parties. Population growth, increasing pressure on
agricultural lands, corruption, and the scourge of HIV/AIDS pose
major problems for Malawi.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Malawi has made great improvements in maternal and child health,
but has made less progress in reducing its high fertility rate. In
both rural and urban areas, very high proportions of mothers are
receiving prenatal care and skilled birth assistance, and most
children are being vaccinated. Malawi’s fertility rate, however,
has only declined slowly, decreasing from more than 7 children per
woman in the 1980s to about 5.5 today. Nonetheless, Malawians
prefer smaller families than in the past, and women are
increasingly using contraceptives to prevent or space pregnancies.
Rapid population growth and high population density is putting
pressure on Malawi’s land, water, and forest resources. Reduced
plot sizes and increasing vulnerability to climate change, further
threaten the sustainability of Malawi’s agriculturally based
economy and will worsen food shortages. About 80% of the population
is employed in agriculture.Historically, Malawians migrated abroad in search of work,
primarily to South Africa and present-day Zimbabwe, but
international migration became uncommon after the 1970s, and most
migration in recent years has been internal. During the colonial
period, Malawians regularly migrated to southern Africa as contract
farm laborers, miners, and domestic servants. In the decade and a
half after independence in 1964, the Malawian Government sought to
transform its economy from one dependent on small-scale farms to
one based on estate agriculture. The resulting demand for wage
labor induced more than 300,000 Malawians to return home between
the mid-1960s and the mid-1970s. In recent times, internal
migration has generally been local, motivated more by marriage than
economic reasons.</subsection>

note: on 21 March 2022, the US Centers for Disease

Africa; Malawi is currently considered a high risk to travelers for
circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV); vaccine-derived
poliovirus (VDPV) is a strain of the weakened poliovirus that was
initially included in oral polio vaccine (OPV) and that has
changed over time and behaves more like the wild or naturally
occurring virus; this means it can be spread more easily to
people who are unvaccinated against polio and who come in contact
with the stool or respiratory secretions, such as from a sneeze, of
an “infected” person who received oral polio vaccine; the CDC
recommends that before any international travel, anyone
unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated, or with an unknown polio
vaccination status should complete the routine polio vaccine
series; before travel to any high-risk destination, the CDC
recommends that adults who previously completed the full, routine
polio vaccine series receive a single, lifetime booster dose of

      <subsection title="Food insecurity">severe localized food insecurity: due to
reduced incomes and shortfalls in cereal production - an
estimated 1.65 million people are facing “Crisis” levels of food
insecurity between January and March 2022, underpinned by localized
shortfalls in cereal production and the lingering impact of an
economic downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic; a moderate decline
in cereal production in 2022, particularly in southern districts,
and increasing food prices are expected to lead to an increased
prevalence of food insecurity in the last quarter of 2022; the
prevalence of food insecurity is likely to increase in the second
half of 2022 and early 2023 mainly due to the high food prices and
low cereal production in southern districts; in addition to the
adverse impacts of the low cereal harvest in the south and high
food prices across the country, a third factor that is foreseen to
contribute to a worsening of food insecurity conditions is the
forecasted slow economic growth in 2022, underpinned by the

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: with few resources, Malawi
is one of the world’s least developed countries; there has been
little investment in fixed-line telecom infrastructure, and as a
result, the country’s two mobile networks Airtel Malawi and TMN
provide the vast majority of connections for voice and data
services; both operators have invested in LTE technologies to
improve the quality of data services; the lack of market
competition, together with limited international internet
bandwidth, has also resulted in some of the highest prices for
telecom services in the region; the government in late 2020 secured
an average 80% reduction in the cost of data bundles offered by the
MNOs; following continuing customer complaints, the regulator in
mid-2021 ensured that costs were again reduced, this time by about
a third; mobile penetration remains low in comparison to the
regional average and so there are considerable opportunities for
further growth, particularly in the mobile broadband sector; low
penetration is partly attributed to the lack of competition, though
there is the possibility that a new play come launch services by
the end of 2022; the internet sector is reasonably competitive,
with about 50 licensed ISPs, though the limited availability and
high cost of international bandwidth has held back growth and kept
broadband access prices among the highest in the region; these
limitations are being addressed, with the second phase of the
national fiber backbone having started in mid-2021 (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: limited fixed-line subscribership less
than 1 per 100 households; mobile-cellular services are expanding
but network coverage is limited and is based around the main urban
areas; mobile-cellular subscribership roughly 52 per 100 households
(2020)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 265; satellite earth
stations - 2 Intelsat (1 Indian Ocean, 1 Atlantic Ocean)
(2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
