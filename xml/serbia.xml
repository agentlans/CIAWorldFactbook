   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was formed in 1918;
its name was changed to Yugoslavia in 1929. Communist Partisans
resisted the Axis occupation and division of Yugoslavia from 1941
to 1945 and fought nationalist opponents and collaborators as well.
The military and political movement headed by Josip Broz "TITO"
(Partisans) took full control of Yugoslavia when their domestic
rivals and the occupiers were defeated in 1945. Although
communists, TITO and his successors (Tito died in 1980) managed to
steer their own path between the Warsaw Pact nations and the West
for the next four and a half decades. In 1989, Slobodan MILOSEVIC
became president of the Republic of Serbia and his ultranationalist
calls for Serbian domination led to the violent breakup of
Yugoslavia along ethnic lines. In 1991, Croatia, Slovenia, and
Macedonia declared independence, followed by Bosnia in 1992. The
remaining republics of Serbia and Montenegro declared a new Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) in April 1992 and under MILOSEVIC's
leadership, Serbia led various military campaigns to unite ethnic
Serbs in neighboring republics into a "Greater Serbia." These
actions ultimately failed and, after international intervention,
led to the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords in 1995.MILOSEVIC retained control over Serbia and eventually became
president of the FRY in 1997. In 1998, an ethnic Albanian
insurgency in the formerly autonomous Serbian province of Kosovo
provoked a Serbian counterinsurgency campaign that resulted in
massacres and massive expulsions of ethnic Albanians living in
Kosovo. The MILOSEVIC government's rejection of a proposed
international settlement led to NATO's bombing of Serbia in the
spring of 1999. Serbian military and police forces withdrew from
Kosovo in June 1999, and the UN Security Council authorized an
interim UN administration and a NATO-led security force in Kosovo.
FRY elections in late 2000 led to the ouster of MILOSEVIC and the
installation of democratic government. In 2003, the FRY became the
State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, a loose federation of the two
republics. Widespread violence predominantly targeting ethnic Serbs
in Kosovo in March 2004 led to more intense calls to address
Kosovo's status, and the UN began facilitating status talks in
2006. In June 2006, Montenegro seceded from the federation and
declared itself an independent nation. Serbia subsequently gave
notice that it was the successor state to the union of Serbia and
Montenegro.In February 2008, after nearly two years of inconclusive
negotiations, Kosovo declared itself independent of Serbia - an
action Serbia refuses to recognize. At Serbia's request, the UN
General Assembly (UNGA) in October 2008 sought an advisory opinion
from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on whether Kosovo's
unilateral declaration of independence was in accordance with
international law. In a ruling considered unfavorable to Serbia,
the ICJ issued an advisory opinion in July 2010 stating that
international law did not prohibit declarations of independence. In
late 2010, Serbia agreed to an EU-drafted UNGA Resolution
acknowledging the ICJ's decision and calling for a new round of
talks between Serbia and Kosovo, this time on practical issues
rather than Kosovo's status. Serbia and Kosovo signed the first
agreement of principles governing the normalization of relations
between the two countries in April 2013 and are in the process of
implementing its provisions. In 2015, Serbia and Kosovo reached
four additional agreements within the EU-led Brussels Dialogue
framework. These included agreements on the Community of
Serb-Majority Municipalities; telecommunications; energy production
and distribution; and freedom of movement. President Aleksandar
VUCIC has promoted an ambitious goal of Serbia joining the EU by
2025. Under his leadership as prime minister, in 2014 Serbia opened
formal negotiations for accession.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">Serbia’s telecom industry has been liberalized in line with the principles of the EU’s regulatory framework for communications, focused on encouraging competition in telecom products and services, and ensuring universal access; considerable network investment has been undertaken in Serbia by incumbent and alternative operators in recent years, despite economic difficulties; this has helped to stimulate internet usage, which has also been bolstered by improved affordability as prices are reduced through competition; the pandemic has stimulated consumer take up of services, particularly mobile data; the government’s various initiatives to improve rural broadband availability have also been supported by European development loans; Serbia’s high mobile services, partly the result of multiple SIM card use, has weighed on revenue growth in recent years, placing further pressure on operators to develop business models which encourage consumer use of mobile data services also in response to the continued substitution of fixed-line for mobile voice calls; the regulator has yet to auction 5G-suitable frequencies, though operators are already investing in their networks in preparation for this next growth frontier; during 2021 the regulator resumed the process towards a 5G spectrum auction, which had been delayed owing to the onset of the covid-19 pandemic (2022)</note>
