   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">After centuries of Danish, Swedish, German, and Russian rule,
Estonia attained independence in 1918. Forcibly incorporated into
the USSR in 1940 - an action never recognized by the US and many
other countries - it regained its freedom in 1991 with the collapse
of the Soviet Union. Since the last Russian troops left in 1994,
Estonia has been free to promote economic and political ties with
the West. It joined both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004,
formally joined the OECD in late 2010, and adopted the euro as its
official currency on 1 January 2011.</subsection>

various interpretations are linked to the flag colors; blue
represents faith, loyalty, and devotion, while also reminiscent of
the sky, sea, and lakes of the country; black symbolizes the soil
of the country and the dark past and suffering endured by the
Estonian people; white refers to the striving towards enlightenment
and virtue, and is the color of birch bark and snow, as well as
summer nights illuminated by the midnight sun</subsection>

market continues to progress with a range of regulatory measures
which have enabled alternative operators to chip away at the
fixed-line market share; fixed-line infrastructure upgrades have
been focused on fiber, and the legacy DSL network has gradually
been replaced; limited commercial 5G deployments have been made
though an expansion of service availability awaits the delayed
auction of spectrum in the 3.5GHz band, which is expected to be

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased

Estonian parliament added to its domestic ratification act a
historical preamble referencing the Soviet occupation and Estonia's
pre-war borders under the 1920 Treaty of Tartu; Russia contends
that the preamble allows Estonia to make territorial claims on
Russia in the future, while Estonian officials deny that the
preamble has any legal impact on the treaty text; Russia demands
better treatment of the Russian-speaking population in Estonia; as
a member state that forms part of the EU's external border, Estonia
implements strict Schengen border rules with Russia</subsection>

stateless persons: 70,604 (2022); note - following

for demurring on Estonian citizenship was to retain the right of
visa-free travel to Russia; stateless residents can vote in local
elections but not general elections; stateless parents who have
been lawful residents of Estonia for at least five years can apply
for citizenship for their children before they turn 15 years
old</subsection>
