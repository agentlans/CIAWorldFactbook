   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Tunisia has been the nexus of many different colonizations
including those of the Phoenicians (as early as the 12 century
B.C.), the Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, Byzantines, various Arab
and Berber kingdoms, and the Ottomans (16th to late
19th centuries). Rivalry between French and Italian
interests in Tunisia culminated in a French invasion in 1881 and
the creation of a protectorate. Agitation for independence in the
decades following World War I was finally successful in convincing
the French to recognize Tunisia as an independent state in 1956.
The country's first president, Habib BOURGUIBA, established a
strict one-party state. He dominated the country for 31 years,
repressing Islamic fundamentalism and establishing rights for women
unmatched by any other Arab nation. In November 1987, BOURGUIBA was
removed from office and replaced by Zine el Abidine BEN ALI in a
bloodless coup. Street protests that began in Tunis in December
2010 over high unemployment, corruption, widespread poverty, and
high food prices escalated in January 2011, culminating in rioting
that led to hundreds of deaths. On 14 January 2011, the same day
BEN ALI dismissed the government, he fled the country, and by late
January 2011, a "national unity government" was formed. Elections
for the new Constituent Assembly were held in late October 2011,
and in December, it elected human rights activist Moncef MARZOUKI
as interim president. The Assembly began drafting a new
constitution in February 2012 and, after several iterations and a
months-long political crisis that stalled the transition, ratified
the document in January 2014. Parliamentary and presidential
elections for a permanent government were held at the end of 2014.
Beji CAID ESSEBSI was elected as the first president under the
country's new constitution. Following ESSEBSI’s death in office in
July 2019, Tunisia moved its scheduled presidential election
forward two months and after two rounds of voting, Kais SAIED was
sworn in as president in October 2019. Tunisia also held
legislative elections on schedule in October 2019. SAIED's term, as
well as that of Tunisia's 217-member parliament, expires in 2024.
On 25 July 2021, SAIED seized exceptional powers allowed under
Tunisia's constitution to fire the prime minister and suspend the
legislature.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">The Tunisian Government took steps in the 1960s to decrease
population growth and gender inequality in order to improve
socioeconomic development. Through its introduction of a national
family planning program (the first in Africa) and by raising the
legal age of marriage, Tunisia rapidly reduced its total fertility
rate from about 7 children per woman in 1960 to 2 in 2022. Unlike
many of its North African and Middle Eastern neighbors, Tunisia
will soon be shifting from being a youth-bulge country to having a
transitional age structure, characterized by lower fertility and
mortality rates, a slower population growth rate, a rising median
age, and a longer average life expectancy.Currently, the sizable young working-age population is straining
Tunisia’s labor market and education and health care systems.
Persistent high unemployment among Tunisia’s growing workforce,
particularly its increasing number of university graduates and
women, was a key factor in the uprisings that led to the overthrow
of the BEN ALI regime in 2011. In the near term, Tunisia’s large
number of jobless young, working-age adults; deficiencies in
primary and secondary education; and the ongoing lack of job
creation and skills mismatches could contribute to future unrest.
In the longer term, a sustained low fertility rate will shrink
future youth cohorts and alleviate demographic pressure on
Tunisia’s labor market, but employment and education hurdles will
still need to be addressed.Tunisia has a history of labor emigration. In the 1960s, workers
migrated to European countries to escape poor economic conditions
and to fill Europe’s need for low-skilled labor in construction and
manufacturing. The Tunisian Government signed bilateral labor
agreements with France, Germany, Belgium, Hungary, and the
Netherlands, with the expectation that Tunisian workers would
eventually return home. At the same time, growing numbers of
Tunisians headed to Libya, often illegally, to work in the
expanding oil industry. In the mid-1970s, with European countries
beginning to restrict immigration and Tunisian-Libyan tensions
brewing, Tunisian economic migrants turned toward the Gulf
countries. After mass expulsions from Libya in 1983, Tunisian
migrants increasingly sought family reunification in Europe or
moved illegally to southern Europe, while Tunisia itself developed
into a transit point for Sub-Saharan migrants heading to
Europe.Following the ousting of BEN ALI in 2011, the illegal migration
of unemployed Tunisian youths to Italy and onward to France soared
into the tens of thousands. Thousands more Tunisian and foreign
workers escaping civil war in Libya flooded into Tunisia and joined
the exodus. A readmission agreement signed by Italy and Tunisia in
April 2011 helped stem the outflow, leaving Tunisia and
international organizations to repatriate, resettle, or accommodate
some 1 million Libyans and third-country nationals.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Military - note">as of 2022, the Tunisian military’s primary operational areas of
focus were counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, and border
security; it was conducting counterterrorism and counterinsurgency
operations against al-Qa’ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and
Islamic State of ash-Sham (ISIS)-linked militants who have been
fighting a low-intensity insurgency, mostly in the mountainous
region along the border with Algeria, particularly the Chaambi
Mountains near the city of Kasserine; the military maintained the
lead role for security in this area and also routinely conducted
joint operations with Algerian security forces against these
groups, as well to counter smuggling and trafficking activities;
the military in recent years also has increased its role in
securing the southern border against militant activity, smuggling,
and trafficking from war-torn Libya; since 2015, Tunisia has
constructed a complex structure of berms, trenches, and
water-filled moats, complemented by electronic surveillance
equipment such as motion detectors, ground surveillance radars, and
infrared sensors along the 220-kilometer border with Libya; in the
remote southern areas of the border with Libya, buffer/exclusion
zones have also been established where the military has the lead
for counterterrorism efforts; outside of these border areas, the
Ministry of Interior (MOI) has the lead responsibility for
counter-terrorism in Tunisia, particularly for urban areas; the
National Police Anti-Terrorism Brigade (BAT) and the National Guard
Special Unit have the lead for MOI counterterrorism
operations

Tunisia has Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA) status with the US; MNNA is
a designation under US law that provides foreign partners with
certain benefits in the areas of defense trade and security
cooperation; while MNNA status provides military and economic
privileges, it does not entail any security commitments (2022)</subsection>
