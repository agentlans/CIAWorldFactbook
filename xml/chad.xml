   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Chad emerged from a collection of powerful states that
controlled the Sahelian belt starting around the 9th
century. These states focused on controlling trans-Saharan trade
routes and profited mostly from the slave trade. The Kanem-Bornu
Empire, centered around the Lake Chad Basin, existed between the
9th and 19th centuries, and during its peak,
the empire controlled territory stretching from southern Chad to
southern Libya and included portions of modern-day Algeria,
Cameroon, Nigeria, Niger, and Sudan. The Sudanese warlord Rabih
AZ-ZUBAYR used an army comprised largely of slaves to conquer the
Kanem-Bornu Empire in the late 19th century. In
southeastern Chad, the Bagirmi and Ouaddai (Wadai) kingdoms emerged
in the 15th and 16th centuries and lasted
until the arrival of the French in the 19th and
20th centuries. France began moving into the region in
the late 1880s and defeated the Bagirmi kingdom in 1897, Rabih
AZ-ZUBAYR in 1900, and the Ouddai kingdom in 1909. In the arid
regions of northern Chad and southern Libya, an Islamic order
called the Sanusiyya (Sanusi) relied heavily on the trans-Saharan
slave trade and had upwards of 3 million followers by the 1880s.
The French arrived in the region in the early 1900s and defeated
the Sanusiyya in 1910 after years of intermittent war. By 1910,
France had incorporated the northern arid region, the Lake Chad
Basin, and southeastern Chad into French Equatorial Africa.
 Chad achieved its independence in 1960 and saw three decades of
instability, oppressive rule, civil war, and a Libyan invasion.
With the help of the French military and several African countries,
Chadian leaders expelled Libyan forces during the 1987 "Toyota
War," so named for the use of Toyota pickup trucks as fighting
vehicles. In 1990, Chadian general Idriss DEBY led a rebellion
against President Hissene HABRE. Under DEBY, Chad drafted and
approved a constitution and held elections in 1996. DEBY led the
country until April 2021 when he was killed during a rebel
incursion. Shortly after his death, a group of military officials -
led by former President DEBY’s son, Mahamat Idriss DEBY - took
control of the government. The military officials dismissed the
National Assembly, suspended the Constitution, and formed a
Transitional Military Council while pledging to hold democratic
elections in October 2022.Chad faces widespread poverty, an economy severely weakened by
low international oil prices, and rebel and terrorist-led
insurgencies in the Lake Chad Basin. Additionally, northern Chad
has seen several waves of rebellions since 1998. In late 2015, the
government imposed a state of emergency in the Lake Chad Basin
following multiple attacks by the terrorist group Boko Haram, now
known as ISIS-West Africa. In mid-2015, Boko Haram conducted
bombings in N'Djamena. In late 2019, the Chadian government also
declared a state of emergency in the Sila and Ouaddai regions
bordering Sudan and in the Tibesti region bordering Niger where
rival ethnic groups are still fighting. The army has suffered heavy
losses to Islamic terror groups in the Lake Chad Basin. In March
2020, Islamic militants attacked a Chadian military camp in the
Lake Chad Basin and killed nearly 100 soldiers; it was the
deadliest attack in the history of the Chadian military.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Despite the start of oil production in 2003, around 40% of
Chad’s population lived below the poverty line as of 2018. The
population will continue to grow rapidly because of the country’s
very high fertility rate and large youth cohort – more than 65% of
the populace is under the age of 25 as of 2022 – although the
mortality rate is high and life expectancy is low. Chad has the
world’s second highest maternal mortality rate as of 2017. Among
the primary risk factors are poverty, anemia, rural habitation,
high fertility, poor education, and a lack of access to family
planning and obstetric care. Impoverished, uneducated adolescents
living in rural areas are most affected. To improve women’s
reproductive health and reduce fertility, Chad will need to
increase women’s educational attainment, job participation, and
knowledge of and access to family planning. Less than a quarter of
women are literate, less than 10% use contraceptives, and more than
40% undergo genital cutting.As of December 2022, more than 403,000 refugees from Sudan and
more than 120,000 from the Central African Republic strain Chad’s
limited resources and create tensions in host communities.
Thousands of new refugees fled to Chad in 2013 to escape worsening
violence in the Darfur region of Sudan. The large refugee
populations are hesitant to return to their home countries because
of continued instability. Chad was relatively stable in 2012 in
comparison to other states in the region, but past fighting between
government forces and opposition groups and inter-communal violence
have left more than 380,000 of its citizens displaced in the
eastern part of the country as of 2022.</subsection>

         <note title="note 2">Chad is also part of a four (formerly five)-nation anti-jihadist task force known as the G4 Sahel Group, set up in 2014 with Chad, Mali (withdrew in 2022), Mauritania, and Niger; it has committed 550 troops and 100 gendarmes to the force; as of 2020, defense forces from each of the participating states were allowed to pursue terrorist fighters up to 100 km into neighboring countries; the force is backed by France, the UN, and the US</note>
      </subsection>
      <subsection title="Military - note">as of 2022, the ANT was chiefly focused on counterterrorism and
counterinsurgency operations; it was engaged with the Boko Haram
(BH) and the Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA) terrorist groups
in the Lake Chad Basin area (primarily the Lac Province) and in the
Sahel, particularly the tri-border area with Burkina Faso, Mali,
and Niger; in addition, the ANT was conducting operations against
internal anti-government militias and armed dissident groups

several rebel groups operate in northern Chad from bases in
southern Libya, including the FACT (Front pour le Changement et la
Concorde au Tchad), the Military Command Council for the Salvation
of the Republic le Conseil de Commandement Militaire pour le salut
de la République or CCSMR), the Union of Forces for Democracy and
Development (le Union des Forces pour la Démocratie et le
Développement or UFDD), and the Union of Resistance Forces (le
Union des Forces de la Résistance UFR); former Chadian President
Idriss DEBY was killed in April 2021 during fighting in the
northern part of the country between the FACT and the Chadian Army;
some armed groups, including the UFDD and UFR, signed an accord in
August 2022 in return for the release of prisoners, amnesty, and an
end to hostilities between the Chadian Government and these armed
factions; however, other armed groups, including the FACT and
CCSMR, refused to join the accord (2022)</subsection>

         <note title="tier rating">Tier 2 Watch List — Chad does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking but is making significant efforts to do so; officials investigated trafficking cases and finalized a National Action Plan for 2021-2022 and began implementation of standard operating procedures and a National Referral Mechanism for identifying and referring victims for care; however, the government did not demonstrate overall increased efforts to increase anti-trafficking capacity; government turnover hindered Chad’s ability to maintain consistent anti-trafficking efforts and reporting; authorities did not report prosecuting or convicting any traffickers, identifying victims, or conducting awareness campaigns; nonetheless, because the government has devoted sufficient resources to a written plan that, if implemented, would constitute significant efforts to meet the minimum standards, Chad was granted a waiver per the TVPA from downgrade to Tier 3; therefore, Chad remained on Tier 2 Watch List for the third consecutive year (2022)</note>
         <note title="trafficking profile">human traffickers exploit domestic and foreign victims in Chad, and traffickers exploit Chadian victims abroad; most trafficking is internal; some children are sent by their parents to relatives or intermediaries to receive education, an apprenticeship, goods, or money and are then forced to work in domestic service or cattle herding; children are also forced to work in agriculture, gold mines, charcoal vending, and fishing, and those attending Koranic schools are forced into begging and street vending; girls from rural areas who search for work in larger towns are exploited in sex trafficking and domestic servitude; terrorist groups abduct children to serve as soldiers, suicide bombers, brides, and forced laborers (2022)</note>
