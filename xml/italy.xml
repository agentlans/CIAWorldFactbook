   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Italy became a nation-state in 1861 when the regional states of
the peninsula, along with Sardinia and Sicily, were united under
King Victor EMMANUEL II. An era of parliamentary government came to
a close in the early 1920s when Benito MUSSOLINI established a
Fascist dictatorship. His alliance with Nazi Germany led to Italy's
defeat in World War II. A democratic republic replaced the monarchy
in 1946 and economic revival followed. Italy is a charter member of
NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC) and its subsequent
successors the EC and the EU. It has been at the forefront of
European economic and political unification, joining the Economic
and Monetary Union in 1999. Persistent problems include sluggish
economic growth, high youth and female unemployment, organized
crime, corruption, and economic disparities between southern Italy
and the more prosperous north.</subsection>

volcano; flank eruptions pose a threat to nearby Sicilian villages;
Etna, along with the famous Vesuvius, which remains a threat to the
millions of nearby residents in the Bay of Naples area, have both
been deemed Decade Volcanoes by the International Association of
Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior, worthy of study
due to their explosive history and close proximity to human
populations; Stromboli, on its namesake island, has also been
continuously active with moderate volcanic activity; other

Larderello, Pantelleria, Vulcano, and Vulsini</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Italy’s large telecom
market has one of the most progressive fiber sectors in Europe,
with regulatory measures encouraging network sharing; regulatory
measures have also been introduced to facilitate access to next
generation networks (NGNs), and a number of deals have been
brokered which enable the main telcoms to provide bundled services
to large numbers of the population; Italy’s vibrant mobile market
has one of the highest subscription rates in Europe, though the
number of subscribers has fallen in recent years as customers
respond to attractive off-net pricing which has reduced the
financial benefit of having SIM cards from different providers;
network companies were among the first in Europe to trial services
based on 5G; the high cost also encouraged the regulator in early
2021 to consider extending the licenses by an additional six years

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
