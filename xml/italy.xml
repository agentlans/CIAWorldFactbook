   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Italy became a nation-state in 1861 when the regional states of
the peninsula, along with Sardinia and Sicily, were united under
King Victor EMMANUEL II. An era of parliamentary government came to
a close in the early 1920s when Benito MUSSOLINI established a
Fascist dictatorship. His alliance with Nazi Germany led to Italy's
defeat in World War II. A democratic republic replaced the monarchy
in 1946 and economic revival followed. Italy is a charter member of
NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC) and its subsequent
successors the EC and the EU. It has been at the forefront of
European economic and political unification, joining the Economic
and Monetary Union in 1999. Persistent problems include sluggish
economic growth, high youth and female unemployment, organized
crime, corruption, and economic disparities between southern Italy
and the more prosperous north.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">Italyâs large telecom market has one of the most progressive fiber sectors in Europe, with regulatory measures encouraging network sharing; regulatory measures have also been introduced to facilitate access to next generation networks (NGNs), and a number of deals have been brokered which enable the main telcoms to provide bundled services to large numbers of the population; Italyâs vibrant mobile market has one of the highest subscription rates in Europe, though the number of subscribers has fallen in recent years as customers respond to attractive off-net pricing which has reduced the financial benefit of having SIM cards from different providers; network companies were among the first in Europe to trial services based on 5G; the high cost also encouraged the regulator in early 2021 to consider extending the licenses by an additional six years (2021)</note>
