   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Seeking to stop the incorporation of their land into Rhodesia
(Zimbabwe) or the Union of South Africa, in 1885, three tribal
chiefs traveled to Great Britain and successfully lobbied the
British Government to put "Bechuanaland" under UK protection. Upon
independence in 1966, the British protectorate of Bechuanaland
adopted the new name of Botswana. More than five decades of
uninterrupted civilian leadership, progressive social policies, and
significant capital investment have created one of the most stable
economies in Africa. The ruling Botswana Democratic Party has won
every national election since independence; President Mokgweetsi
Eric MASISI assumed the presidency in April 2018 following the
retirement of former President Ian KHAMA due to constitutional term
limits. MASISI won his first election as president in October 2019,
and he is Botswana’s fifth president since independence. Mineral
extraction, principally diamond mining, dominates economic
activity, though tourism is a growing sector due to the country's
conservation practices and extensive nature preserves. Botswana has
one of the world's highest rates of HIV/AIDS infection but also one
of Africa's most progressive and comprehensive programs for dealing
with the disease.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Botswana has experienced one of the most rapid declines in
fertility in Sub-Saharan Africa. The total fertility rate fell from
more than 5 children per woman in the mid 1980s to approximately
2.4 in 2013, and remains at that level in 2022. The fertility
reduction has been attributed to a host of factors, including
higher educational attainment among women, greater participation of
women in the workforce, increased contraceptive use, later first
births, and a strong national family planning program. Botswana was
making significant progress in several health indicators, including
life expectancy and infant and child mortality rates, until being
devastated by the HIV/AIDs epidemic in the 1990s.In 2021,  Botswana had one of the highest HIV/AIDS
prevalence rates in the world at close to 20%, however
comprehensive and effective treatment programs have reduced
HIV/AIDS-related deaths. The combination of declining fertility and
increasing mortality rates because of HIV/AIDS is slowing the
population aging process, with a narrowing of the youngest age
groups and little expansion of the oldest age groups. Nevertheless,
having the bulk of its population (about 60% as of 2022) of working
age will only yield economic benefits if the labor force is
healthy, educated, and productively employed.Batswana have been working as contract miners in South Africa
since the 19th century. Although Botswana’s economy improved
shortly after independence in 1966 with the discovery of diamonds
and other minerals, its lingering high poverty rate and lack of job
opportunities continued to push workers to seek mining work in
southern African countries. In the early 1970s, about a third of
Botswana’s male labor force worked in South Africa (lesser numbers
went to Namibia and Zimbabwe). Not until the 1980s and 1990s, when
South African mining companies had reduced their recruitment of
foreign workers and Botswana’s economic prospects had improved,
were Batswana increasingly able to find job opportunities at
home.Most Batswana prefer life in their home country and choose
cross-border migration on a temporary basis only for work,
shopping, visiting family, or tourism. Since the 1970s, Botswana
has pursued an open migration policy enabling it to recruit
thousands of foreign workers to fill skilled labor shortages. In
the late 1990s, Botswana’s prosperity and political stability
attracted not only skilled workers but small numbers of refugees
from neighboring Angola, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">effective regulatory reform has made Botswana’s telecom market one of the most liberalized in the region; there is a service-neutral licensing regime adapted to the convergence of technologies and services, and several operators now compete in all telecom sectors; Botswana has one of the highest mobile penetration rates in Africa; in a bid to generate new revenue streams and secure market share, the three mobile network operators have entered the underdeveloped broadband sector by adopting of 3G, LTE, and WiMAX technologies; in the fixed-line broadband market they compete with a large number of ISPs, some of which have rolled out their own wireless access infrastructure; the landlocked country depends on satellites for international bandwidth, and on other countries for transit capacity to the landing points of international submarine cables; the landing of additional cables in the region in recent years has improved the competitive situation in this sector, while prices for connectivity have fallen dramatically (2022)</note>
         <note title="domestic">fixed-line teledensity has declined in recent years and now stands at roughly 6 telephones per 100 persons; mobile-cellular teledensity is roughly 163 telephones per 100 persons (2020)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>

colonial times, with the British colonial administrators relying
instead on small, lightly armed constabularies such as the
Bechuanaland Mounted Police, the Bechuanaland Border Police, and by
the early 1960s, the Police Mobile Unit (PMU); after independence
in 1966, Botswana militarized the PMU and gave it responsibility
for the country’s defense rather than create a conventional
military force; however, turmoil in neighboring countries and
numerous cross-border incursions by Rhodesian and South African
security forces in the 1960s and 1970s demonstrated that the PMU
was inadequate for defending the country and led to the
establishment of the Botswana Defense Force (BDF) in 1977; as of
2022, the BDF’s primary missions included securing territorial
integrity/border security and internal duties such as disaster
relief and anti-poaching

Botswana participates in the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) Standby Force, and beginning in 2021 contributed nearly 300
troops to the SADC’s effort to help the Mozambique Government
