   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Carib Indians occupied the islands of the West Indies for
hundreds of years before the British and French began settlement in
1623. During the course of the 17th century, Saint Kitts became the
premier base for English and French expansion into the Caribbean.
The French ceded the territory to the UK in 1713. At the turn of
the 18th century, Saint Kitts was the richest British Crown Colony
per capita in the Caribbean, a result of the sugar trade. Although
small in size and separated by only 3 km (2 mi) of water, Saint
Kitts and Nevis were viewed and governed as different states until
the late-19th century, when the British forcibly unified them along
with the island of Anguilla. In 1967, the island territory of Saint
Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla became an associated state of the UK
with full internal autonomy. The island of Anguilla rebelled and
was allowed to secede in 1971. The remaining islands achieved
independence in 1983 as Saint Kitts and Nevis. In 1998, a
referendum on Nevis to separate from Saint Kitts fell short of the
two-thirds majority vote needed.</subsection>
