   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Carib Indians occupied the islands of the West Indies for
hundreds of years before the British and French began settlement in
1623. During the course of the 17th century, Saint Kitts became the
premier base for English and French expansion into the Caribbean.
The French ceded the territory to the UK in 1713. At the turn of
the 18th century, Saint Kitts was the richest British Crown Colony
per capita in the Caribbean, a result of the sugar trade. Although
small in size and separated by only 3 km (2 mi) of water, Saint
Kitts and Nevis were viewed and governed as different states until
the late-19th century, when the British forcibly unified them along
with the island of Anguilla. In 1967, the island territory of Saint
Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla became an associated state of the UK
with full internal autonomy. The island of Anguilla rebelled and
was allowed to secede in 1971. The remaining islands achieved
independence in 1983 as Saint Kitts and Nevis. In 1998, a
referendum on Nevis to separate from Saint Kitts fell short of the
two-thirds majority vote needed.</subsection>

etymology: Saint Kitts was, and still is, referred
to as Saint Christopher and this name was well established by the
17th century (although who first applied the name is unclear); in
the 17th century a common nickname for Christopher was Kit or Kitt,
so the island began to be referred to as "Saint Kitt's Island" or
just "Saint Kitts"; Nevis is derived from the original Spanish name
"Nuestra Senora de las Nieves" (Our Lady of the Snows) and refers
to the white halo of clouds that generally wreathes Nevis

etymology: the French name translates as "low

within a valley, as well as to the fact that the city is on the
