   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The native Amerindian population of Cuba began to decline after
the arrival of Christopher COLUMBUS in 1492 and following its
development as a Spanish colony during the next several centuries.
Large numbers of African slaves were imported to work the coffee
and sugar plantations, and Havana became the launching point for
the annual treasure fleets bound for Spain from Mexico and Peru.
Spanish rule eventually provoked an independence movement and
occasional rebellions were harshly suppressed. US intervention
during the Spanish-American War in 1898 assisted the Cubans in
overthrowing Spanish rule. The Treaty of Paris established Cuban
independence from Spain in 1898 and, following three-and-a-half
years of subsequent US military rule, Cuba became an independent
republic in 1902 after which the island experienced a string of
governments mostly dominated by the military and corrupt
politicians. Fidel CASTRO led a rebel army to victory in 1959; his
authoritarian rule held the subsequent regime together for nearly
five decades. He handed off the presidency in February 2008 to his
younger brother Raul CASTRO. Cuba's communist revolution, with
Soviet support, was exported throughout Latin America and Africa
during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Miguel DIAZ-CANEL Bermudez,
hand-picked by Raul CASTRO to succeed him, was approved as
president by the National Assembly and took office on 19 April
2018. DIAZ-CANEL was appointed First Secretary of the Communist
Party on 19 April 2021 following the retirement of Raul CASTRO, and
continues to serve as both president and first secretary.Cuba traditionally and consistently portrays the US embargo, in
place since 1961, as the source of its difficulties. As a result of
efforts begun in December 2014 to reestablish diplomatic relations
with the Cuban Government, which were severed in January 1961, the
US and Cuba reopened embassies in their respective countries in
July 2015. The embargo remains in place, and the relationship
between the US and Cuba remains tense. Illicit migration of Cuban nationals to the US via maritime and
overland routes has been a longstanding challenge. On 12 January
2017, the US and Cuba signed a Joint Statement ending the so-called
"wet-foot, dry-foot" policy – by which Cuban nationals who reached
US soil were permitted to stay. Irregular Cuban maritime migration
has dropped significantly since FY 2016, when migrant interdictions
at sea topped 5,000, but land border crossings continue. In FY
2021, the US Coast Guard interdicted 838 Cuban nationals at sea.
Also in FY 2021, 39,303 Cuban nationals presented themselves at
various land border ports of entry throughout the US.</subsection>

increased substantially over the past few years, but only about 64
percent of Cubans have Internet access, and even fewer
Cubans--about 60 percent of the population--have access to cell
phone service; in 2021 the Cuban Government passed a decree that
strengthened its authority to censor Internet and telephonic
communications; state control of the telecom sector hinders
development; Cuba has the lowest mobile phone and Internet
subscription rates in the region; fixed-line density is also very
low; thaw of US-Cuba relations encouraged access to services, such
as Wi-Fi hot spots; access to sites is controlled and censored; DSL
and Internet are available in Havana, though costs are too high for
most Cubans; international investment and agreement to improve
Internet access through cost-free and direct connection between
networks (2021)<br/>

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

      <subsection title="Trafficking in persons">tier rating:Tier 3 — Cuba does not fully meet the minimum standards for the
elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to
do so; the government made some efforts to investigate, prosecute,
and convict sex traffickers and sex tourists and identified and
provided assistance to some victims; however, no efforts were made
to address forced labor; there was a government policy or pattern
to profit from labor export programs with strong indications of
forced labor, particularly in foreign medical missions; authorities
did not protect potential trafficking victims, leaving them at risk
of being detained or charged for crimes their traffickers forced
them to commit (2020)<br/>
