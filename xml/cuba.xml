   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The native Amerindian population of Cuba began to decline after
the arrival of Christopher COLUMBUS in 1492 and following its
development as a Spanish colony during the next several centuries.
Large numbers of African slaves were imported to work the coffee
and sugar plantations, and Havana became the launching point for
the annual treasure fleets bound for Spain from Mexico and Peru.
Spanish rule eventually provoked an independence movement and
occasional rebellions were harshly suppressed. US intervention
during the Spanish-American War in 1898 assisted the Cubans in
overthrowing Spanish rule. The Treaty of Paris established Cuban
independence from Spain in 1898 and, following three-and-a-half
years of subsequent US military rule, Cuba became an independent
republic in 1902 after which the island experienced a string of
governments mostly dominated by the military and corrupt
politicians. Fidel CASTRO led a rebel army to victory in 1959; his
authoritarian rule held the subsequent regime together for nearly
five decades. He handed off the presidency in February 2008 to his
younger brother Raul CASTRO. Cuba's communist revolution, with
Soviet support, was exported throughout Latin America and Africa
during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Miguel DIAZ-CANEL Bermudez,
hand-picked by Raul CASTRO to succeed him, was approved as
president by the National Assembly and took office on 19 April
2018. DIAZ-CANEL was appointed First Secretary of the Communist
Party on 19 April 2021 following the retirement of Raul CASTRO, and
continues to serve as both president and first secretary.Cuba traditionally and consistently portrays the US embargo, in
place since 1961, as the source of its difficulties. As a result of
efforts begun in December 2014 to reestablish diplomatic relations
with the Cuban Government, which were severed in January 1961, the
US and Cuba reopened embassies in their respective countries in
July 2015. The embargo remains in place, and the relationship
between the US and Cuba remains tense. Illicit migration of Cuban nationals to the US via maritime and
overland routes has been a longstanding challenge. On 12 January
2017, the US and Cuba signed a Joint Statement ending the so-called
"wet-foot, dry-foot" policy – by which Cuban nationals who reached
US soil were permitted to stay. Irregular Cuban maritime migration
has dropped significantly since FY 2016, when migrant interdictions
at sea topped 5,000, but land border crossings continue. In FY
2021, the US Coast Guard interdicted 838 Cuban nationals at sea.
Also in FY 2021, 39,303 Cuban nationals presented themselves at
various land border ports of entry throughout the US.</subsection>
