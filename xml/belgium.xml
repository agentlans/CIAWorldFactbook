      <subsection title="Background">Belgium became independent from the Netherlands in 1830; it was
occupied by Germany during World Wars I and II. The country
prospered in the past half century as a modern, technologically
advanced European state and member of NATO and the EU. In recent
years, political divisions between the Dutch-speaking Flemish of
the north and the French-speaking Walloons of the south have led to
constitutional amendments granting these regions formal recognition
and autonomy. The capital city of Brussels is home to numerous
international organizations, including the EU and NATO.</subsection>

preparation for launching services; the auction of 5G-suitable
spectrum has been delayed to the beginning of 2022, while the
onerous restrictions on radiation have meant that some 5G trials
have been suspended; there is effective competition in Belgium
between the DSL and cable platforms, while in recent years
government support has also encouraged investment in fiber
networks; in a bid to encourage investment in under served areas,
the regulator in 2018 amended the conditions by which market
players grant wholesale access to copper and fiber infrastructure;
in May 2019 it opened a further consultation on cost models for

downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
