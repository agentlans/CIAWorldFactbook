   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Belgium became independent from the Netherlands in 1830; it was
occupied by Germany during World Wars I and II. The country
prospered in the past half century as a modern, technologically
advanced European state and member of NATO and the EU. In recent
years, political divisions between the Dutch-speaking Flemish of
the north and the French-speaking Walloons of the south have led to
constitutional amendments granting these regions formal recognition
and autonomy. The capital city of Brussels is home to numerous
international organizations, including the EU and NATO.</subsection>
