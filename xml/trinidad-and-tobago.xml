   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">First colonized by the Spanish, the islands came under British
control in the early 19th century. The islands' sugar industry was
hurt by the emancipation of the slaves in 1834. Manpower was
replaced with the importation of contract laborers from India
between 1845 and 1917, which boosted sugar production as well as
the cocoa industry. The discovery of oil on Trinidad in 1910 added
another important export. Independence was attained in 1962. The
country is one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean thanks
largely to petroleum and natural gas production and processing.
Tourism, mostly in Tobago, is targeted for expansion and is
growing. The government is struggling to reverse a surge in violent
crime.</subsection>
