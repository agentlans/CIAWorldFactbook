   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Greece achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1830.
During the second half of the 19th century and the first half of
the 20th century, it gradually added neighboring islands and
territories, most with Greek-speaking populations. In World War II,
Greece was first invaded by Italy (1940) and subsequently occupied
by Germany (1941-44); fighting endured in a protracted civil war
between supporters of the king and other anti-communist and
communist rebels. Following the latter's defeat in 1949, Greece
joined NATO in 1952. In 1967, a group of military officers seized
power, establishing a military dictatorship that suspended many
political liberties and forced the king to flee the country. In
1974 following the collapse of the dictatorship, democratic
elections and a referendum created a parliamentary republic and
abolished the monarchy. In 1981, Greece joined the EC (now the EU);
it became the 12th member of the European Economic and Monetary
Union in 2001. Greece has suffered a severe economic crisis since
late 2009, due to nearly a decade of chronic overspending and
structural rigidities. Beginning in 2010, Greece entered three
bailout agreements - the first two with the European Commission,
the European Central Bank, and the IMF; and the third in 2015 with
the European Stability Mechanism - worth in total about $300
billion. The Greek Government formally exited the third bailout in
August 2018.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Greece’s telecom market is
susceptible to the country’s volatile economy, and as a result
revenue among the key networks has been variable; broadband
subscriptions in Greece are developing steadily despite the
difficult economic conditions; the main networks are concentrating
investment on fiber-based next generation networks, enabling them
to reach the European broadband targets for 2025; their work is
also supported by government ultra-fast broadband projects, largely
funded by the EC and aimed at delivering a service of at least
100Mb/s to under served areas; Greece’s well-developed mobile
market is dominated by the three MNOs; Networks continue to invest
in LTE infrastructure and technologies to provide networks capable
of meeting customer demand for data services; after extensive
trials of 5G, the MNOs were able to launch commercial services in
early 2021 following the December 2020 allocation of frequencies in
a range of bands; the rapid rollout of 5G encouraged the shut down
of the 3G network (a process expected to be completed by the end of
2021) and reallocate for LTE and 5G. (2022)<br/>

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
