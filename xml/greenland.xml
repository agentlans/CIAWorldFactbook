      <subsection title="Background">Greenland, the world's largest island, is about 80% ice-capped.
Vikings reached the island in the 10th century from Iceland; Danish
colonization began in the 18th century, and Greenland became an
integral part of the Danish Realm in 1953. It joined the European
Community (now the EU) with Denmark in 1973 but withdrew in 1985
over a dispute centered on stringent fishing quotas. Greenland
remains a member of the Overseas Countries and Territories
Association of the EU. Greenland was granted self-government in
1979 by the Danish parliament; the law went into effect the
following year. Greenland voted in favor of increased self-rule in
November 2008 and acquired greater responsibility for internal
affairs when the Act on Greenland Self-Government was signed into
law in June 2009. Denmark, however, continues to exercise control
over several policy areas on behalf of Greenland, including foreign
affairs, security, and financial policy in consultation with
Greenland's Self-Rule Government.</subsection>

cable connects south and west Greenland to the rest of the world,

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
