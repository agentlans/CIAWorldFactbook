   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Ancient Vietnam was centered on the Red River Valley and was
under Han Chinese rule until approximately the 10th
century. The Ly Dynasty (11th-13th century)
ruled the first independent Vietnamese state, which was known as
Dai Viet, and established their capital at Thang Long (Hanoi).
Under the Tran Dynasty (13th-15th century),
Dai Viet forces led by one of Vietnam’s national heroes, TRAN Hang
Dao, fought off Mongol invaders in 1279. Following a brief Chinese
occupation in the early 1400s, the leader of Vietnamese resistance,
LE Thai To, made himself emperor and established the Le Dynasty,
which lasted until the late 18th century, although not
without decades of political turmoil, civil war, and division.
During this period, Dai Viet expanded southward to the Central
Highlands and Mekong Delta, reaching the approximate boundaries of
modern-day Vietnam by the 1750s. Dai Viet suffered additional civil
war and division in the latter half of the 18th century,
but was reunited and renamed Vietnam under Emperor NGUYEN Phuc Anh
(aka Gia Long) in 1802.<br/>
         <br/>
The Nguyen Dynasty would be the last Vietnamese dynasty before the
conquest by France, which began in 1858 and was completed by 1884.
Vietnam became part of French Indochina in 1887. It declared
independence after World War II, but France continued to rule until
its 1954 defeat by communist forces under Ho Chi MINH. Under the
Geneva Accords of 1954, Vietnam was divided into the communist
North and anti-communist South. Fighting erupted between the two
governments shortly afterwards with the North supporting communist
rebels in the South and eventually committing thousands of combat
troops, while the US provided large amounts of economic and
military assistance, including combat forces, to the South. The US
military presence reached a peak strength of over 500,000 troops in
1968. US forces were withdrawn following a cease-fire agreement in
1973. Two years later, North Vietnamese forces overran the South
reuniting the country under communist rule. The conflict, known as
the Second Indochina War (1955-1975), devastated the country,
spilled over into the neighboring countries of Cambodia and Laos,
and is estimated to have resulted in the deaths of up to 3 million
Vietnamese civilians and soldiers. Despite the return of peace, for
over a decade the country experienced little economic growth
because of its diplomatic isolation, its conservative leadership
policies, and the persecution and mass exodus of individuals, many
of them successful South Vietnamese merchants. However, since the
enactment of Vietnam's "doi moi" (renovation) policy in 1986,
Vietnamese authorities have committed to increased economic
liberalization and enacted structural reforms needed to modernize
the economy and to produce more competitive, export-driven
industries. Since implementation, the economy has seen strong
growth, particularly in agricultural and industrial production,
construction, exports, and foreign investment. Increased tourism
has also become a key component of economic growth. Nevertheless,
the Communist Party maintains tight political and social control of
the country and Vietnam faces considerable challenges including
rising income inequality, corruption, inadequate social welfare,
and a poor human rights record.<br/>
         <br/>
Since withdrawing its military occupation forces from Cambodia in
the late 1980s and the end of Soviet aid by 1991, Vietnam has
practiced a non-aligned foreign policy that emphasizes friendly
ties with all members of the international community. Relatedly,
Vietnam adheres to a security doctrine called the "Four Nos" (no
alliances, no siding with one country against another, no foreign
bases, and no using force in international relations). Despite
longstanding tensions with Beijing regarding its expansive claims
that overlap with Hanoi's own claimed maritime boundaries in the
South China Sea, Vietnam puts a priority on stable relations with
China, given its proximity, size, and status as Vietnam's largest
trading partner.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">When Vietnam was reunified in 1975, the country had a youthful
age structure and a high fertility rate.  The population
growth rate slowed dramatically during the next 25 years, as
fertility declined and infant mortality and life expectancy
improved.  The country’s adoption of a one-or-two-child policy
in 1988 led to increased rates of contraception and abortion. 
The total fertility rate dropped rapidly from nearly 5 in 1979 to
2.1 or replacement level in 1990, and at 1.8 is below replacement
level today.  Fertility is higher in the more rural central
highlands and northern uplands, which are inhabited primarily by
poorer ethnic minorities, and is lower among the majority Kinh,
ethnic Chinese, and a few other ethnic groups, particularly in
urban centers.  With more than two-thirds of the population of
working age (15-64), Vietnam has the potential to reap a
demographic dividend for approximately three decades (between 2010
and 2040).  However, its ability to do so will depend on
improving the quality of education and training for its workforce
and creating jobs.  The Vietnamese Government is also
considering changes to the country’s population policy because if
the country’s fertility rate remains below replacement level, it
could lead to a worker shortage in the future.Vietnam has experienced both internal migration and net
emigration, both for humanitarian and economic reasons, for the
last several decades.  Internal migration – rural-rural and
rural-urban, temporary and permanent – continues to be a means of
coping with Vietnam’s extreme weather and flooding.  Although
Vietnam’s population is still mainly rural, increasing numbers of
young men and women have been drawn to the country’s urban centers
where they are more likely to find steady jobs and higher pay in
the growing industrial and service sectors.The aftermath of the Vietnam War in 1975 resulted in an
outpouring of approximately 1.6 million Vietnamese refugees over
the next two decades.  Between 1975 and 1997, programs such as
the Orderly Departure Program and the Comprehensive Plan of Action
resettled hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese refugees abroad,
including the United States (880,000), China (260,000, mainly
ethnic Chinese Hoa), Canada (160,000), Australia (155,000), and
European countries (150,000). </subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: even with Covid-19
pandemic-related mobility restrictions in place, Vietnam’s economy
has continued to outperform the rest of the region in 2020 and
2021; the telecom sector essentially spent most of this period in a
holding pattern, focusing on maintaining service throughout the
crisis while preparing for some major changes to come in the mobile
market in 2022; both fixed-line telephony and mobile have
experienced small drops in subscriber numbers since the start of
the pandemic, but the similarities between the two markets end
there; fixed-line teledensity continued its downwards trajectory
towards virtual oblivion, with just 3% penetration (around 3
million subscribers) at the start of 2021; the mobile market has
lost about the same number of subscribers since the end of 2019,
but has been sitting on much higher penetration levels around 130%
for many years; growth is expected to kick in again in 2022
following the anticipated launch of commercial 5G mobile services
along with a range of government-led schemes to move consumers
completely off 2G and 3G; one example is the planned redistribution
of GSM/3G bandwidth to LTE; in addition to propelling Vietnam into
having one of the most advanced mobile markets in the world, this
should also spur on the mobile broadband segment; with a
penetration level of just over 70%, mobile broadband has
considerable room to grow; increasing economic prosperity coupled
with the latest smartphone technology and networks should see
mobile broadband underwriting the country’s telecommunications
sector for at least the next few years; this report includes the
regulator's market data to July 2021, telcos' financial and
operating data updates to June 2021, Telecom Maturity Index charts
and analyses, assessment of the global impact of Covid-19 on the
telecoms sector, and other recent market developments (2021)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: all provincial exchanges are digitalized
and connected to Hanoi, Da Nang, and Ho Chi Minh City by
fiber-optic cable or microwave radio relay networks; main lines
have been increased, and the use of mobile telephones is growing
rapidly; fixed-line under 4 per 100 and mobile-cellular nearly 143

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

   <section title="Transnational Issues">
      <subsection title="Disputes - international">Vietnam-Cambodia: Cambodia accuses Vietnam of a wide
variety of illicit cross-border activities; issues include casinos
built in Cambodia near the border, narcotics trafficking,
trafficking of women and children, petrol smuggling, illegal
logging, and illegal migration; progress on a joint development
area with Cambodia is hampered by an unresolved dispute over
sovereignty of offshore islands; in December 2021, leaders from the
two countries agreed to fully complete the remaining border
demarcation and the upgrading of border checkpointsVietnam-Cambodia-Laos: Cambodia and Laos protest
Vietnamese squatters and armed encroachments along border; Cambodia
accuses Vietnam of a wide variety of illicit cross-border
activitiesVietnam-China: an estimated 300,000 Vietnamese refugees
reside in China; the decade-long demarcation of the China-Vietnam
land boundary was completed in 2009; small territorial exchanges
were made during the demarcation; China occupies the Paracel
Islands also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan; cross border
trafficking in women and children and illegal wildlife trade are
problems along this border; In December 2021, China tightened its
border controls over COVID concerns, restricting an important trade
route for VietnamVietnam-Laos: Laos opened a strategically important
international border crossing with Vietnam in 2021, which will
shorten the distance for goods and people transiting between
Thailand and Vietnam</subsection>
      <subsection title="Refugees and internally displaced persons">stateless persons: 35,475 (2022); note -
Vietnam's stateless ethnic Chinese Cambodian population dates to
the 1970s when thousands of Cambodians fled to Vietnam to escape
the Khmer Rouge and were no longer recognized as Cambodian
citizens; Vietnamese women who gave up their citizenship to marry
foreign men have found themselves stateless after divorcing and
returning home to Vietnam; the government addressed this problem in
2009, and Vietnamese women are beginning to reclaim their
citizenship</subsection>
      <subsection title="Trafficking in persons">tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List — Vietnam does
not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of
trafficking but is making significant efforts to do so; efforts
include providing trafficking victims the right to legal
representation in judicial proceedings, increasing the amount of
shelter time for victims by one month, providing financial support,
continuing large-scale awareness campaigns in vulnerable
communities and to workers going overseas, and training law
enforcement; however, fewer victims were identified or assisted and
procedures remained slow and ineffective; provincial officials
unfamiliar with anti-trafficking law impede anti-trafficking
efforts; labor recruitment firms extorted illegal high fees from
workers looking for overseas employment putting them at risk for
forced labor; no investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of
officials complicit in trafficking offenses were made (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
trafficking profile: human traffickers exploit
domestic and foreign victims in Vietnam, and traffickers exploit
Vietnamese abroad; Vietnamese men and women who migrate abroad for
work may be subject to exploitation and illegally high fees from
recruiters trapping them in debt bondage; traffickers subject
victims to forced labor in construction, fishing, agriculture,
mining, maritime industries, logging, and manufacturing, primarily
in Taiwan, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Laos, Japan, and to a
lesser extent, some parts of Europe and the UK; traffickers mislead
Vietnamese women and children with fraudulent employment
opportunities and sex traffick them to brothels on the borders of
China, Cambodia, Laos, and elsewhere in Asia; traffickers use the
Internet, gaming sites, and particularly social media to lure
victims; domestic traffickers are sometimes  family members or
small-scale networks exploiting Vietnamese men, women, and children
- including street children and children with disabilities - in
forced labor as street beggars or in brick kilns and mines; child
sex tourists from elsewhere in Asia and other countries exploit
children; prisoners reportedly are forced to work in agriculture,
manufacturing, and hazardous industries, such as cashew
processing</subsection>
      <subsection title="Illicit drugs">transshipment point for transnational criminal organizations
(TCOs) trafficking heroin, crystal methamphetamine, and ketamine
