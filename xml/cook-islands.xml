   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Polynesians from Tahiti were probably the first people to settle
Rarotonga around A.D. 900. Over time, Samoans and Tongans also
settled in Rarotonga, and Rarotongans voyaged to the northern Cook
Islands, settling Manihiki and Rakahanga. Pukapuka and Penrhyn in
the northern Cook Islands were settled directly from Samoa. Prior
to European contact, there was considerable travel and trade
between inhabitants of the different islands and atolls but they
were not united in a single political entity. Spanish navigators
were the first Europeans to spot the northern Cook Islands in 1595
followed by the first landing in 1606. The Cook Islands remained
free of further European contact until the 1760s, and in 1773,
British explorer James COOK saw Manuae in the southern Cook
Islands. The islands were named after COOK in the 1820s by Russian
mapmakers. English missionary activity during the 1820s and 1830s
banned singing and dancing and converted most of the
population.<br/>
         <br/>
Fearing France would militarily occupy the islands like it did in
Tahiti, Rarotongans asked the UK for protectorate status in the
1840s and 1860s, which the UK ignored. In 1888, Queen MAKEA TAKAU
of Rarotonga formally petitioned for protectorate status, which the
UK reluctantly agreed to. In 1901, the UK placed Rarotonga and the
rest of the islands in the New Zealand Colony and in 1915, the Cook
Islands Act organized the Cook Islands into one political entity.
It remained a protectorate until 1965, when New Zealand granted the
Cook Islands self-government status. The Cook Islands has a great
deal of local autonomy and is an independent member of
international organizations, but it is in free association with New
Zealand, which is responsible for defense and foreign affairs.
Economic opportunities in the Cook Islands are sparse, and more
Cook Islanders live in New Zealand than in the Cook Islands.<br/>
         <br/>
In a referendum in 1994, voters chose to keep the name Cook Islands
rather than changing to a Maori name for the islands. The issue was
revived in 2019, but after being poorly received by the diaspora in
New Zealand, the government decided to retain the name Cook Islands
but to provide a Maori name alongside it. The Maori name has not
yet been determined.</subsection>

satellite earth stations, microwave systems, and VHF and HF
radiotelephone (2020)<br/>

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
