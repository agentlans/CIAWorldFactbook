   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Explored and settled by the Spanish in the 16th century, Panama
broke with Spain in 1821 and joined a union of Colombia, Ecuador,
and Venezuela - named the Republic of Gran Colombia. When the
latter dissolved in 1830, Panama remained part of Colombia. With US
backing, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903 and promptly signed a
treaty with the US allowing for the construction of a canal and US
sovereignty over a strip of land on either side of the structure
(the Panama Canal Zone). The Panama Canal was built by the US Army
Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914. In 1977, an agreement was
signed for the complete transfer of the Canal from the US to Panama
by the end of the century. Certain portions of the Zone and
increasing responsibility over the Canal were turned over in the
subsequent decades. With US help, dictator Manuel NORIEGA was
deposed in 1989. The entire Panama Canal, the area supporting the
Canal, and remaining US military bases were transferred to Panama
by the end of 1999. An ambitious expansion project to more than
double the Canal's capacity - by allowing for more Canal transits
and larger ships - was carried out between 2007 and 2016.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Panama is a country of demographic and economic contrasts. It is
in the midst of a demographic transition, characterized by steadily
declining rates of fertility, mortality, and population growth, but
disparities persist based on wealth, geography, and ethnicity.
Panama has one of the fastest growing economies in Latin America
and dedicates substantial funding to social programs, yet poverty
and inequality remain prevalent. The indigenous population accounts
for a growing share of Panama's poor and extreme poor, while the
non-indigenous rural poor have been more successful at rising out
of poverty through rural-to-urban labor migration. The government's
large expenditures on untargeted, indirect subsidies for water,
electricity, and fuel have been ineffective, but its conditional
cash transfer program has shown some promise in helping to decrease
extreme poverty among the indigenous population.Panama has expanded access to education and clean water, but the
availability of sanitation and, to a lesser extent, electricity
remains poor. The increase in secondary schooling - led by female
enrollment - is spreading to rural and indigenous areas, which
probably will help to alleviate poverty if educational quality and
the availability of skilled jobs improve. Inadequate access to
sanitation contributes to a high incidence of diarrhea in Panama's
children, which is one of the main causes of Panama's elevated
chronic malnutrition rate, especially among indigenous
communities.</subsection>
