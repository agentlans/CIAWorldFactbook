   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Spratly Islands consist of more than 100 small islands or
reefs surrounded by rich fishing grounds - and potentially by gas
and oil deposits. They are claimed in their entirety by China,
Taiwan, and Vietnam, while portions are claimed by Malaysia and the
Philippines. About 45 islands are occupied by relatively small
numbers of military forces from China, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Taiwan, and Vietnam. Since 1985, Brunei has claimed a continental
shelf that overlaps a southern reef but has not made any formal
claim to the reef. Brunei claims an exclusive economic zone over
this area.</subsection>

   <section title="Military and Security">
      <subsection title="Military - note">the Spratly Islands consist of more than 100 small islands or
reefs of which about 45 are claimed and occupied by China,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam<br/>
         <br/>
China: occupies 7 outposts (Fiery Cross, Mischief,
Subi, Cuarteron, Gavin, Hughes, and Johnson reefs); the outposts on
Fiery Cross, Mischief, and Subi include air bases with helipads and
aircraft hangers, naval port facilities, surveillance radars, air
defense and anti-ship missile sites, and other military
infrastructure such as communications, barracks, maintenance
facilities, and ammunition and fuel bunkers<br/>
         <br/>
Malaysia:  occupies 5 outposts in the
southern portion of the archipelago, closest to the Malaysian state
of Sabah (Ardasier Reef, Eric Reef, Mariveles Reef, Shallow Reef,
and Investigator Shoal); all the outposts have helicopter landing
pads, while Shallow Reef also has an airstrip<br/>
         <br/>
Philippines: occupies 9 features (Commodore Reef,
Second Thomas Shoal, Flat Island, Loaita Cay, Loaita Island,
Nanshan Island, Northeast Cay, Thitu Island, and West York Island);
Thitu Island has the only Philippine airstrip in the Spratlys<br/>
         <br/>
Taiwan: maintains a coast guard outpost with an
airstrip on Itu Aba Island<br/>
         <br/>
Vietnam: occupies about 50 outposts spread across
27 features, including facilities on 21 rocks and reefs in the
Spratlys, plus 14 platforms known as “economic, scientific, and
technological service stations,” or Dịch vụ-Khoa (DK1), on six
underwater banks to the southeast that Vietnam does not consider
part of the disputed island chain, although China and Taiwan
disagree; Spratly Islands outposts are on Alison Reef, Amboyna Cay,
Barque Canada Reef, Central Reef, Collins Reef, Cornwallis South
Reef, Discovery Great Reef, East Reef, Grierson Reef, Ladd Reef,
Landsdowne Reef, Namyit Island, Pearson Reef, Petley Reef, Sand
Cay, Sin Cowe Island, South Reef, Southwest Cay, Spratly Island,
Tennent Reef, West Reef; Spratly Island includes an airstrip with
aircraft hangers; the six underwater banks with outposts include
Vanguard, Rifleman, Prince of Wales, Prince Consort, Grainger, and
Alexandra; over the past few years, Vietnam has continued to make
modest improvements to its outposts, including defensive positions
and infrastructure (2022)</subsection>

   <section title="Transnational Issues">
      <subsection title="Disputes - international">Taiwan-Brunei-China-Malaysia-Philippines-Vietnam: all
of the Spratly Islands are claimed by China (including Taiwan) and
Vietnam; parts of them are claimed by Brunei, Malaysia and the
Philippines; despite no public territorial claim to Louisa Reef,
Brunei implicitly lays claim by including it within the natural
prolongation of its continental shelf and basis for a seabed median
with Vietnam; the islands are strategically located in the South
China Sea and are surrounded by rich fishing groups and potential
oil and natural gas deposits; claimants in November 2002 signed the
"Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea,"
which eased tensions but fell short of a legally binding "code of
conduct"; in March 2005, the national oil companies of China, the
Philippines, and Vietnam signed a joint accord to conduct marine
seismic activities in the Spratly Islands; China’s island-building
and military presence in the archipelago remain controversial</subsection>
