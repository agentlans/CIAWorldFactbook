   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Spratly Islands consist of more than 100 small islands or
reefs surrounded by rich fishing grounds - and potentially by gas
and oil deposits. They are claimed in their entirety by China,
Taiwan, and Vietnam, while portions are claimed by Malaysia and the
Philippines. About 45 islands are occupied by relatively small
numbers of military forces from China, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Taiwan, and Vietnam. Since 1985, Brunei has claimed a continental
shelf that overlaps a southern reef but has not made any formal
claim to the reef. Brunei claims an exclusive economic zone over
this area.</subsection>

reefs of which about 45 are claimed and occupied by China,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam
<note title="China">occupies 7 outposts (Fiery Cross, Mischief, Subi, Cuarteron, Gavin, Hughes, and Johnson reefs); the outposts on Fiery Cross, Mischief, and Subi include air bases with helipads and aircraft hangers, naval port facilities, surveillance radars, air defense and anti-ship missile sites, and other military infrastructure such as communications, barracks, maintenance facilities, and ammunition and fuel bunkers</note>
         <note title="Malaysia ">occupies 5 outposts in the southern portion of the archipelago, closest to the Malaysian state of Sabah (Ardasier Reef, Eric Reef, Mariveles Reef, Shallow Reef, and Investigator Shoal); all the outposts have helicopter landing pads, while Shallow Reef also has an airstrip</note>
         <note title="Philippines ">occupies 9 features (Commodore Reef, Second Thomas Shoal, Flat Island, Loaita Cay, Loaita Island, Nanshan Island, Northeast Cay, Thitu Island, and West York Island); Thitu Island has the only Philippine airstrip in the Spratlys</note>
         <note title="Taiwan">maintains a coast guard outpost with an airstrip on Itu Aba Island</note>
         <note title="Vietnam">occupies about 50 outposts spread across 27 features, including facilities on 21 rocks and reefs in the Spratlys, plus 14 platforms known as “economic, scientific, and technological service stations,” or Dịch vụ-Khoa (DK1), on six underwater banks to the southeast that Vietnam does not consider part of the disputed island chain, although China and Taiwan disagree; Spratly Islands outposts are on Alison Reef, Amboyna Cay, Barque Canada Reef, Central Reef, Collins Reef, Cornwallis South Reef, Discovery Great Reef, East Reef, Grierson Reef, Ladd Reef, Landsdowne Reef, Namyit Island, Pearson Reef, Petley Reef, Sand Cay, Sin Cowe Island, South Reef, Southwest Cay, Spratly Island, Tennent Reef, West Reef; Spratly Island includes an airstrip with aircraft hangers; the six underwater banks with outposts include Vanguard, Rifleman, Prince of Wales, Prince Consort, Grainger, and Alexandra; over the past few years, Vietnam has continued to make modest improvements to its outposts, including defensive positions and infrastructure (2022)</note>

   <section title="Transnational Issues">
      <subsection title="Disputes - international">Taiwan-Brunei-China-Malaysia-Philippines-Vietnam: all
of the Spratly Islands are claimed by China (including Taiwan) and
Vietnam; parts of them are claimed by Brunei, Malaysia and the
Philippines; despite no public territorial claim to Louisa Reef,
Brunei implicitly lays claim by including it within the natural
prolongation of its continental shelf and basis for a seabed median
with Vietnam; the islands are strategically located in the South
China Sea and are surrounded by rich fishing groups and potential
oil and natural gas deposits; claimants in November 2002 signed the
"Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea,"
which eased tensions but fell short of a legally binding "code of
conduct"; in March 2005, the national oil companies of China, the
Philippines, and Vietnam signed a joint accord to conduct marine
seismic activities in the Spratly Islands; China’s island-building
and military presence in the archipelago remain controversial</subsection>
