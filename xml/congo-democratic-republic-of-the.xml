   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Kingdom of Kongo ruled the area around the mouth of the
Congo River from the 14th to 19th centuries. To the center and
east, the Kingdoms of Luba and Lunda ruled from the 16th and 17th
centuries to the 19th century. In the 1870s, European exploration
of the Congo Basin, sponsored by King LEOPOLD II of Belgium,
eventually allowed the ruler to acquire rights to the Congo
territory and to make it his private property under the name of the
Congo Free State. During the Free State, the king's colonial
military forced the local population to produce rubber. From 1885
to 1908, millions of Congolese people died as a result of disease
and exploitation. International condemnation finally forced LEOPOLD
to cede the land to Belgium, creating the Belgian Congo.<br/>
         <br/>
The Republic of the Congo gained its independence from Belgium in
1960, but its early years were marred by political and social
instability. Col. Joseph MOBUTU seized power and declared himself
president in a November 1965 coup. He subsequently changed his name
- to MOBUTU Sese Seko - as well as that of the country - to Zaire.
MOBUTU retained his position for 32 years through several sham
elections, as well as through brutal force. Ethnic strife and civil
war, touched off by a massive inflow of refugees in 1994 from
conflict in Rwanda and Burundi, led in May 1997 to the toppling of
the MOBUTU regime by a rebellion backed by Rwanda and Uganda and
fronted by Laurent KABILA. KABILA renamed the country the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), but in August 1998 his
regime was itself challenged by a second insurrection again backed
by Rwanda and Uganda. Troops from Angola, Chad, Namibia, Sudan, and
Zimbabwe intervened to support KABILA's regime. In January 2001,
KABILA was assassinated and his son, Joseph KABILA, was named head
of state. In October 2002, the new president was successful in
negotiating the withdrawal of Rwandan forces occupying the eastern
DRC; two months later, the Pretoria Accord was signed by all
remaining warring parties to end the fighting and establish a
government of national unity. Presidential, National Assembly, and
provincial elections took place in 2006, with Joseph KABILA elected
to office.National elections were held in November 2011 and disputed
results allowed Joseph KABILA to be reelected to the presidency.
While the DRC constitution barred President KABILA from running for
a third term, the DRC Government delayed national elections
originally slated for November 2016, to 30 December 2018. This
failure to hold elections as scheduled fueled significant civil and
political unrest, with sporadic street protests by KABILA’s
opponents and exacerbation of tensions in the tumultuous eastern
DRC regions. Presidential, legislative, and provincial elections
were held in late December 2018 and early 2019 across most of the
country. The DRC Government canceled presidential elections in the
cities of Beni and Butembo (citing concerns over an ongoing Ebola
outbreak in the region) as well as Yumbi (which had recently
experienced heavy violence).Opposition candidate Felix TSHISEKEDI was announced the election
winner on 10 January 2019 and inaugurated two weeks later. This was
the first transfer of power to an opposition candidate without
significant violence or a coup since the DRC's
independence. The DRC, particularly in the East, continues to experience
violence perpetrated by more than 100 armed groups active in the
region, including the Allied Democratic Forces, the Democratic
Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, and assorted Mai Mai militias.
The UN Organization Stabilization Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO) has
operated in the region since 1999 and is the largest and most
expensive UN peacekeeping mission in the world. </subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Despite a wealth of fertile soil, hydroelectric power potential,
and mineral resources, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
struggles with many socioeconomic problems, including high infant
and maternal mortality rates, malnutrition, poor vaccination
coverage, lack of access to improved water sources and sanitation,
and frequent and early fertility. Ongoing conflict, mismanagement
of resources, and a lack of investment have resulted in food
insecurity; almost 25% of children under the age of 5 were
malnourished as of 2018. The overall coverage of basic public
services – education, health, sanitation, and potable water – is
very limited and piecemeal, with substantial regional and
rural/urban disparities. Fertility remains high at more than 5
children per woman and is likely to remain high because of the low
use of contraception and the cultural preference for larger
families.The DRC is a source and host country for refugees. Between 2012
and 2014, more than 119,000 Congolese refugees returned from the
Republic of Congo to the relative stability of northwest DRC, but
more than 1 million Congolese refugees and asylum seekers were
hosted by neighboring countries as of December 2022. In addition,
an estimated 5.5 million Congolese were internally displaced as of
October 2022, the vast majority fleeing violence between rebel
group and Congolese armed forces. Thousands of refugees have come
to the DRC from neighboring countries, including Rwanda, the
Central African Republic, South Sudan, and Burundi.</subsection>

polio and who come in contact with the stool or respiratory
secretions, such as from a sneeze, of an “infected” person who
received oral polio vaccine; the CDC recommends that before any
international travel, anyone unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated,

polio and who come in contact with the stool or respiratory
secretions, such as from a sneeze, of an “infected” person who
received oral polio vaccine; the CDC recommends that before any
international travel, anyone unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated,

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: the telecom system remains
one of the least developed in the region; the government can only
loosely regulate the sector; the investment made in infrastructure
is derived from donor countries or from the efforts of foreign
(particularly Chinese) companies and banks; efforts have been made
to improve the regulation of the telecom sector; the limited
fixed-line infrastructure has become the principal providers of
basic telecom services; the development of the DRC’s internet and
broadband market has been held back by the poorly developed
national and international infrastructure; the country was finally
connected to international bandwidth through the WACS submarine
cable in 2013; breakages in the WACS cable have exposed the
vulnerability of international bandwidth, which is still limited;
the Equiano submarine cable, and has also completed a 5,000km cable
running through the DRC to link to cable systems landing in
countries facing the Atlantic and Indian Oceans; the first
commercial LTE networks were launched in May 2018 soon after LTE
licenses were issued; mobile operators are keen to develop mobile
data services, capitalizing on the growth of smartphones usage;
there has been some progress with updating technologies, most of
the GSM network has been upgraded to 3G by 2021 (2022)<br/>

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

      <subsection title="Military - note">the modern FARDC was created out of the armed factions of the
two Congo wars of 1996-1997 and 1998-2003; as part of the peace
accords that ended the last war, the largest rebel groups were
incorporated into the FARDC; many armed groups, however, continue
to fight and as of 2022, there were over 100 illegal armed groups
operating in the country by some estimates; as of 2022, the FARDC
was actively engaged in combat operations against numerous armed
groups, particularly in the eastern provinces of Ituri, North Kivu,
and South Kivu, although there was also violence in Maniema, Kasai,
Kasai Central, and Tanganyika provinces; the military is widely
assessed as being unable to provide adequate security throughout
the country due to insufficient training, poor morale and
leadership, ill-discipline and corruption, low equipment readiness,
a fractious ethnic makeup, and the sheer size of the country and
diversity of armed rebel groups<br/>
         <br/>
as of 2022, one of the primary armed groups the FARDC was
conducting operations against was the March 23 Movement (M23, aka
Congolese Revolutionary Army), which resumed attacks, largely
against civilians, in the DRC province of North Kivu in 2022 after
having been defeated in 2013 by FARDC and UN forces; the M23's
resurgence has raised tensions between the DRC and Rwanda, as the
DRC Government claims Rwanda backs the M23, which it has labeled a
terrorist group, charges that the Rwandan Government has denied;
M23 attacks and fighting between the FARDC and M23 in 2022 has led
to the displacement of more than 200,000 people; UN troops were
supporting the FARDC's operations against M23<br/>
         <br/>
the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) has operated in the
central and eastern parts of the country since 1999; as of 2022,
MONUSCO had around 15,000 military and police personnel; MONUSCO
includes a Force Intervention Brigade (FIB; 3 infantry battalions,
plus artillery and special forces), the first ever UN peacekeeping
force specifically tasked to carry out targeted offensive
operations to neutralize and disarm groups considered a threat to
state authority and civilian security (2022)</subsection>
