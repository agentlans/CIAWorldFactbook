   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">First inhabited by Arawak and later by Carib Indians, the Virgin
Islands were settled by the Dutch in 1648 and then annexed by the
English in 1672. The islands were part of the British colony of the
Leeward Islands (1872-1960); they were granted autonomy in 1967.
The economy is closely tied to the larger and more populous US
Virgin Islands to the west; the US dollar is the legal currency. On
6 September 2017, Hurricane Irma devastated the island of Tortola.
An estimated 80% of residential and business structures were
destroyed or damaged, communications disrupted, and local roads
rendered impassable.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: the telecom sector has seen
a decline in subscriber numbers (particularly for prepaid mobile
services the mainstay of short term visitors) and revenue; fixed
and mobile broadband services are two areas that have benefited
from the crisis as employees and students have resorted to working
from home; one major casualty may be the region’s second largest
telco operator, Digicel; the company filed for bankruptcy in the US
in April 2020; it continues to operate in all of its Caribbean
markets as it seeks to refinance billions of dollars of debt; the
other major telco, regional incumbent Cable &amp; Wireless
Communications (CWC), is experiencing similar drops in subscriber
numbers and revenue; CWC is expanding and enhancing its fixed and
mobile networks in many of the countries it serves around the
Caribbean, despite many locations being small islands with very
small populations; one area of the telecom market that is not
prepared for growth is 5G mobile; governments, regulators, and even
the mobile network operators have shown that they have not been
investing in 5G opportunities at the present time; network
expansion and enhancements remain concentrated around improving LTE
coverage. (2021)<br/>

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
