      <subsection title="Background">Unique among African countries, the ancient Ethiopian monarchy
maintained its freedom from colonial rule with the exception of a
short-lived Italian occupation from 1936 to 1941. In 1974, a
military junta, the Derg, deposed Emperor Haile SELASSIE (who had
ruled since 1930) and established a socialist state. Torn by bloody
coups, uprisings, wide-scale drought, and massive refugee problems,
the regime was finally toppled in 1991 by a coalition of rebel
forces, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front
(EPRDF). A constitution was adopted in 1994, and Ethiopia's first
multiparty elections were held in 1995.<br/>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Ethiopia is a predominantly agricultural country – nearly 80% of
the population lives in rural areas – that is in the early stages
of demographic transition. Infant, child, and maternal mortality
have fallen sharply over the past decade, but the total fertility
rate has declined more slowly and the population continues to grow.
The rising age of marriage and the increasing proportion of women
remaining single have contributed to fertility reduction. While the
use of modern contraceptive methods among married women has
increased significantly from 6 percent in 2000 to 27 percent in
2012, the overall rate is still quite low.Ethiopia’s rapid population growth is putting increasing
pressure on land resources, expanding environmental degradation,
and raising vulnerability to food shortages. With about 40 percent
of the population below the age of 15 and a fertility rate of 4
children per woman (and even higher in rural areas), Ethiopia will
have to make further progress in meeting its family planning needs
if it is to achieve the age structure necessary for reaping a
demographic dividend in the coming decades.Poverty, drought, political repression, and forced government
resettlement have driven Ethiopia’s internal and external migration
since the 1960s. Before the 1974 revolution, only small numbers of
the Ethiopian elite went abroad to study and then returned home,
but under the brutal Derg regime thousands fled the country,
primarily as refugees. Between 1982 and 1991 there was a new wave
of migration to the West for family reunification. Since the defeat
of the Derg in 1991, Ethiopians have migrated to escape violence
among some of the country’s myriad ethnic groups or to pursue
economic opportunities. Internal and international trafficking of
women and children for domestic work and prostitution is a growing
problem.</subsection>

note: on 21 March 2022, the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Travel Alert for polio in
Africa; Ethiopia is currently considered a high risk to travelers
for circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV);
vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) is a strain of the weakened
poliovirus that was initially included in oral polio vaccine (OPV)
and that has changed over time and behaves more like the wild
or naturally occurring virus; this means it can be spread more
easily to people who are unvaccinated against polio and who come in
contact with the stool or respiratory secretions, such as from a
sneeze, of an “infected” person who received oral polio vaccine;
the CDC recommends that before any international travel, anyone
unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated, or with an unknown polio
vaccination status should complete the routine polio vaccine
series; before travel to any high-risk destination, CDC recommends
that adults who previously completed the full, routine polio
vaccine series receive a single, lifetime booster dose of polio

      <subsection title="Food insecurity">widespread lack of access: due to conflict
in Tigray Region, drought conditions in southeastern areas, high
food prices - The difficult and worsening food security
situation is the result of multiple shocks affecting food
availability and access including: the conflict in northern Tigray
Region and in adjacent areas of Amhara and Afar regions, which
began in November 2020; in Tigray region alone, 5.3 million people
are estimated to be severely food insecure; the failure of the
March‑May 2022 “Gu‑Genna” rains in southern pastoral areas of
southern Oromiya Region and southern Somali Region, exacerbated
drought conditions prevailing since late 2020, causing severe crop
and livestock losses; severe macroeconomic challenges including
insufficient foreign currency reserves and the continuous
depreciation of the national currency, as a result, inflation is at
very high levels, with the year‑on‑year food inflation rate
estimated at 35.5 percent in July, one the highest of the last
decade; these difficulties are exacerbated by the ripple effects of
the Ukraine war, which triggered hikes in international prices of

Party (ADP), Oromo Democratic Party (ODP), Southern Ethiopian
People's Democratic Movement (SEPDM), plus other EPRDF-allied
parties such as the Afar National Democratic Party (ANDP),
Benishangul Gumuz People’s Democratic Party (BGPDP), Gambella
People’s Democratic Movement (GPDM), Somali People’s Democratic
Party (SPDP), and the Harari National League (HNL). Once the
Prosperity Party was created, the various ethnically-based parties
that comprised or were affiliated with the EPRDF were subsequently
disbanded; in January 2021, the Ethiopian electoral board
de-registered the Tigray People’s Liberation Front or TPLF;
national level parties are qualified to register candidates in
multiple regions across Ethiopia; regional parties can register

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: has been one of the last in
Africa to allow its national telco a monopoly on all telecom
services including fixed, mobile, internet and data communications;
this has stifled innovation, restricted network expansion, and
limited the scope of services on offer; the World Bank in early
2021 provided a $200 million loan to help develop the country’s
digital transformation, while the government has embarked on its
2020-2030 program as well as its Digital Ethiopia 2025 strategy,
both aimed at making better use of digital technologies to promote
socioeconomic development (2021)<br/>

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

note 1: in 2020 the Ethiopian Government announced
it had re-established a navy, which had been disbanded in 1996; in March

         <br/>
note: in November 2021, the Ethiopian Government

Sudan (UNMISS) (2022)</subsection>
      <subsection title="Military - note">from November of 2020 until a cease-fire was negotiated in
November 2022, the Government of Ethiopia (GoE) engaged in a
military conflict with the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF),
the former governing party of the Tigray Region; the GoE deemed a
TPLF attack on an ENDF base as a domestic terrorism incident and
launched a military offensive in response; the TPLF asserted that
its actions were self-defense in the face of planned GoE action to
remove it from the provincial government; the GoE sent large
elements of the ENDF into Tigray to remove the TPLF and invited
militia and paramilitary forces from the states of Afar and Amara,
as well as the military forces of Eritrea, to assist; TPLF military
forces were known as the Tigray Defense Force (TDF) and were
comprised of state paramilitary forces, local militia, and troops
that defected from the ENDF; the fighting included heavy civilian
and military casualties with widespread abuses reported<br/>
         <br/>
as of 2023, the ENDF was engaged in counterinsurgency operations
against anti-government militants in several other states,
particularly in Oromya (Oromia) against the Oromo Liberation Army
(OLA; aka Shene), an insurgent group that claimed to be fighting
for greater autonomy for the Oromo, Ethiopia's largest ethnic
group; the OLA was a member of a coalition of eight anti-government
factions known as the United Front of Ethiopia and Confederalist
Forces (UFEFCF); formed in 2021, the UFEFCF included the TPLF, as
well as rebel groups of variable sizes from several regions of the
country; the OLA has also clashed with ethnic militias (aka Fano)
from the neighboring state of Amara<br/>
         <br/>
in July 2022, militants from the Somalia-based terrorist group
al-Shabaab launched an incursion into Ethiopia's Somali (Sumale)
region, attacking villages and security forces; the GoE claimed
that regional security forces killed hundreds of Shabaab fighters
and subsequently deployed additional ENDF troops into Somalia’s
Gedo region to prevent further incursions (2023)</subsection>
