   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Lithuanian lands were united under MINDAUGAS in 1236; over the
next century, through alliances and conquest, Lithuania extended
its territory to include most of present-day Belarus and Ukraine.
By the end of the 14th century Lithuania was the largest state in
Europe. An alliance with Poland in 1386 led the two countries into
a union through the person of a common ruler. In 1569, Lithuania
and Poland formally united into a single dual state, the
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. This entity survived until 1795
when its remnants were partitioned by surrounding countries.
Lithuania regained its independence following World War I but was
annexed by the USSR in 1940 - an action never recognized by the US
and many other countries. On 11 March 1990, Lithuania became the
first of the Soviet republics to declare its independence, but
Moscow did not recognize this proclamation until September of 1991
(following the abortive coup in Moscow). The last Russian troops
withdrew in 1993. Lithuania subsequently restructured its economy
for integration into Western European institutions; it joined both
NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004. In 2015, Lithuania joined
the euro zone, and it joined the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development in 2018.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Lithuania’s small telecoms
market is among the more advanced in Europe, particularly given the
universal access to LTE infrastructure and the extensive fiber
footprint; investment has been focused on fiber broadband and
mobile network upgrades; fiber is now by far the dominant fixed
broadband platform, with the number of DSL and cable connections in
steady decline; SIM card penetration is relatively high for the
region, with a growing proportion of subscribers being on
higher-Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) contract plans; while LTE
services are available nationally, operators have made steady
investments in 5G; the regulator has helped the network operators
to develop 5G by allowing them to repurpose spectrum in the 2.1GHz
and 2.4GHz bands; the regulator is expected to complete the auction
of spectrum in the 700MHz and 3.4GHz bands later in 2022; service
obligations on the licenses include the provision of services to
the five main cities by the end of 2023 (2021)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: nearly 10 per 100 for fixed-line
subscriptions; expansion of mobile-cellular services has resulted
in a steady decline in the number of fixed-line connections;
mobile-cellular teledensity stands at about 134 per 100 persons
(2021)<br/>

international: country code - 370; landing points
for the BCS East, BCS East-West Interlink and NordBalt connecting
Lithuania to Sweden, and Latvia ; further transmission by
satellite; landline connections to Latvia and Poland (2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
