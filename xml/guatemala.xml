   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Maya civilization flourished in Guatemala and surrounding
regions during the first millennium A.D. After almost three
centuries as a Spanish colony, Guatemala won its independence in
1821. During the second half of the 20th century, it experienced a
variety of military and civilian governments, as well as a 36-year
guerrilla war. In 1996, the government signed a peace agreement
formally ending the internal conflict.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Guatemala is a predominantly poor country that struggles in
several areas of health and development, including infant, child,
and maternal mortality, malnutrition, literacy, and contraceptive
awareness and use. The country's large indigenous population is
disproportionately affected. Guatemala is the most populous country
in Central America and has the highest fertility rate in Latin
America. It also has the highest population growth rate in Latin
America, which is likely to continue because of its large
reproductive-age population and high birth rate. Almost half of
Guatemala's population is under age 19, making it the youngest
population in Latin America. Guatemala's total fertility rate has
slowly declined during the last few decades due in part to limited
government-funded health programs. However, the birth rate is still
more close to three children per woman and is markedly higher among
its rural and indigenous populations.Guatemalans have a history of emigrating legally and illegally
to Mexico, the United States, and Canada because of a lack of
economic opportunity, political instability, and natural disasters.
Emigration, primarily to the United States, escalated during the
1960 to 1996 civil war and accelerated after a peace agreement was
signed. Thousands of Guatemalans who fled to Mexico returned after
the war, but labor migration to southern Mexico continues.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">Guatemala’s telecom infrastructure has suffered from years of under investment from state and provincial government; the poor state of fixed-line infrastructure has led to Guatemala having one of the lowest fixed-line teledensities in the region; in many rural regions of the country there is no fixed-line access available, and so mobile services are adopted by necessity; private investment has been supported by government and regulatory efforts, resulting in a steady growth in the number of fixed lines which has supported growth in the fixed broadband segment; delays in launching LTE services left the country lagging behind in the development of mobile broadband and the benefits which it can bring to the country's social and economic growth; two new submarine cables are due for completion by 2022; improved international connectivity should drive further uptake of both fixed and mobile broadband services; intense competition among the networks has helped to improve services and lower prices for end-users; given the commercial impetus of networks, insufficient government financial investment has resulted in many regional areas remaining with poor or non-existent services; the country benefits from one of the most open regulatory frameworks, with all telecom sectors having been open to competition since 1996; mobile subscriptions are on par with the regional average, though the slower growth in the mobile subscriber base suggests a level of market saturation, with the emphasis among networks being on generating revenue via mobile data services (2021)</note>
         <note title="domestic">fixed-line teledensity roughly 13 per 100 persons; fixed-line investments are concentrating on improving rural connectivity; mobile-cellular teledensity about 114 per 100 persons (2020)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>

support the National Civil Police in internal security operations
(as permitted by the constitution) to combat organized crime, gang
violence, and narco-trafficking 

the military held power during most of Guatemala’s 36-year civil
war (1960-1996) and conducted a campaign of widespread violence and
repression, particularly against the country’s majority indigenous
population; more than 200,000 people were estimated to have been
killed or disappeared during the conflict (2022)</subsection>

      <subsection title="Disputes - international">Guatemala-Belize: Demarcated but insecure boundary due
to Guatemala’s claims to more than half of Belizean territory.
 Line of Adjacency operates in lieu of an international
boundary to control influx of Guatemalan squatters onto Belizean
territory. Smuggling, narcotics trafficking, and human trafficking
for sexual exploitation and debt bondage are all problems. Belize
lacks resources to detect and extradite impoverished Guatemalan
peasants squatting in Belizean rain forests in the remote border
areas. Both countries agreed in April 2012 to hold simultaneous
referenda, scheduled for 6 October 2013, to decide whether to refer
the dispute to the ICJ for binding resolution, but this vote was
suspended indefinitely. At present, Belize and Honduras 12-nm
territorial sea claims close off Guatemalan access to Caribbean in
the Bahia de Amatique. Maritime boundary remains unresolved pending
further negotiation.
