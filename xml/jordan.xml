   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Following World War I and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire,
the League of Nations awarded Britain the mandate to govern much of
the Middle East. Britain demarcated a semi-autonomous region of
Transjordan from Palestine in 1921 and recognized ABDALLAH I from
the Hashemite family as the country's first leader. The Hashemites
also controlled Hijaz, or the western coastal area of modern day
Saudi Arabia until 1925, when they were pushed out by Ibn SAUD and
Wahhabi tribes. The country gained its independence in 1946 and
thereafter became The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.<br/>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Jordan’s government has
focused on the use of ICT in a range of sectors, aimed at
transforming the relatively small economy through the use of
digital services; this policy has helped the country rise in the
league tables for digital connectivity and internet readiness, and
it has also attracted investment from foreign companies; during the
ongoing global pandemic, the start-up sector has been further
encouraged to develop solutions to combat the crisis, while other
efforts have facilitated e-government services and encouraged
businesses to adapt to new methods of working through their own
digital transformation; these developments have been supported by
the highly developed mobile sector, led by three major regional
players which have near-comprehensive LTE network coverage
(2022)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: a 1995 telecommunications law opened all
non-fixed-line services to private competition; in 2005, the
monopoly over fixed-line services terminated and the entire
telecommunications sector was opened to competition; currently
fixed-line stands at nearly 4 per 100 persons and multiple
mobile-cellular providers with subscribership over 68 per 100
persons (2020)<br/>

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

due largely to its proximity to regional conflicts in Iraq and
Syria, the presence of major terrorist organizations in both of
those countries, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the highest
priorities of Jordan’s military and security services in 2022
included securing its borders and the potential for domestic
terrorist attacks; the terrorist group Hizballah and Iranian-backed
militia forces were operating in southwestern Syria near Jordan’s
border while fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham
(ISIS) terrorist group continued operating in both Iraq and Syria;
ISIS fighters included Jordanian nationals, some of whom have
returned to Jordan; meanwhile, individuals and groups sympathetic
to Palestine have planned and conducted terrorist attacks in
Jordan<br/>
         <br/>
Jordan has Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA) status with the US; MNNA is a
designation under US law that provides foreign partners with
certain benefits in the areas of defense trade and security
cooperation; while MNNA status provides military and economic
privileges, it does not entail any security commitments<br/>
