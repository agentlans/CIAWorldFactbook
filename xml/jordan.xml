   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Following World War I and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire,
the League of Nations awarded Britain the mandate to govern much of
the Middle East. Britain demarcated a semi-autonomous region of
Transjordan from Palestine in 1921 and recognized ABDALLAH I from
the Hashemite family as the country's first leader. The Hashemites
also controlled Hijaz, or the western coastal area of modern day
Saudi Arabia until 1925, when they were pushed out by Ibn SAUD and
Wahhabi tribes. The country gained its independence in 1946 and
thereafter became The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. </subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">Jordan’s government has focused on the use of ICT in a range of sectors, aimed at transforming the relatively small economy through the use of digital services; this policy has helped the country rise in the league tables for digital connectivity and internet readiness, and it has also attracted investment from foreign companies; during the ongoing global pandemic, the start-up sector has been further encouraged to develop solutions to combat the crisis, while other efforts have facilitated e-government services and encouraged businesses to adapt to new methods of working through their own digital transformation; these developments have been supported by the highly developed mobile sector, led by three major regional players which have near-comprehensive LTE network coverage (2022)</note>
         <note title="domestic">a 1995 telecommunications law opened all non-fixed-line services to private competition; in 2005, the monopoly over fixed-line services terminated and the entire telecommunications sector was opened to competition; currently fixed-line stands at nearly 4 per 100 persons and multiple mobile-cellular providers with subscribership over 68 per 100 persons (2020)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>

Legion, which was formed under the British protectorate of
Transjordan in the 1920s

due largely to its proximity to regional conflicts in Iraq and
Syria, the presence of major terrorist organizations in both of
those countries, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the highest
priorities of Jordan’s military and security services in 2022
included securing its borders and the potential for domestic
terrorist attacks; the terrorist group Hizballah and Iranian-backed
militia forces were operating in southwestern Syria near Jordan’s
border while fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham
(ISIS) terrorist group continued operating in both Iraq and Syria;
ISIS fighters included Jordanian nationals, some of whom have
returned to Jordan; meanwhile, individuals and groups sympathetic
to Palestine have planned and conducted terrorist attacks in
Jordan

Jordan has Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA) status with the US; MNNA is a
designation under US law that provides foreign partners with
certain benefits in the areas of defense trade and security
cooperation; while MNNA status provides military and economic
privileges, it does not entail any security commitments
