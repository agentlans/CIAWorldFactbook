   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">El Salvador achieved independence from Spain in 1821 and from
the Central American Federation in 1839. A 12-year civil war, which
cost about 75,000 lives, was brought to a close in 1992 when the
government and leftist rebels signed a treaty that provided for
military and political reforms. El Salvador is beset by one of the
world's highest homicide rates and pervasive criminal gangs.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">El Salvador is the smallest and most densely populated country
in Central America. It is well into its demographic transition,
experiencing slower population growth, a decline in its number of
youths, and the gradual aging of its population. The increased use
of family planning has substantially lowered El Salvador's
fertility rate, from approximately 6 children per woman in the
1970s to replacement level today. A 2008 national family planning
survey showed that female sterilization remained the most common
contraception method in El Salvador - its sterilization rate is
among the highest in Latin America and the Caribbean - but that the
use of injectable contraceptives is growing. Fertility differences
between rich and poor and urban and rural women are narrowing.Salvadorans fled during the 1979 to 1992 civil war mainly to the
United States but also to Canada and to neighboring Mexico,
Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. Emigration to the
United States increased again in the 1990s and 2000s as a result of
deteriorating economic conditions, natural disasters (Hurricane
Mitch in 1998 and earthquakes in 2001), and family reunification.
At least 20% of El Salvador's population lives abroad. The
remittances they send home account for close to 20% of GDP, are the
second largest source of external income after exports, and have
helped reduce poverty.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">El Salvador is the smallest country in central America geographically, it has the fourth largest economy in the region; the country’s telecom sector has been restricted by poor infrastructure and unequal income distribution; there have been organizational delays which have slowed the development of telecom services; El Salvador’s fixed-line teledensity is substantially lower than the Latin American and Caribbean average; there has been a significant drop in the number of fixed lines since 2010, particularly in 2017, largely due to the substitution for mobile-only alternatives; about 94% of all telephony lines in the country are on mobile networks; mobile subscriptions are remarkably high considering El Salvador’s economic indicators, being about a third higher than average for Latin America and the Caribbean; the country was one of the last in the region to provide LTE services, mainly due to the inadequate provision of suitable spectrum; the multi-spectrum auction conducted at the end of 2019 has allowed MNOs to improve the reach and quality of their service offerings; El Salvador’s telecom legislation is one of the more liberal in Latin America, encouraging competition in most areas and permitting foreign investment; there are no regulations which promote wholesale broadband; the only effective cross-platform competition in the broadband market comes from the few cable operators; there has been some market consolidation in recent years (2021)</note>
