   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">El Salvador achieved independence from Spain in 1821 and from
the Central American Federation in 1839. A 12-year civil war, which
cost about 75,000 lives, was brought to a close in 1992 when the
government and leftist rebels signed a treaty that provided for
military and political reforms. El Salvador is beset by one of the
world's highest homicide rates and pervasive criminal gangs.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">El Salvador is the smallest and most densely populated country
in Central America. It is well into its demographic transition,
experiencing slower population growth, a decline in its number of
youths, and the gradual aging of its population. The increased use
of family planning has substantially lowered El Salvador's
fertility rate, from approximately 6 children per woman in the
1970s to replacement level today. A 2008 national family planning
survey showed that female sterilization remained the most common
contraception method in El Salvador - its sterilization rate is
among the highest in Latin America and the Caribbean - but that the
use of injectable contraceptives is growing. Fertility differences
between rich and poor and urban and rural women are narrowing.Salvadorans fled during the 1979 to 1992 civil war mainly to the
United States but also to Canada and to neighboring Mexico,
Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. Emigration to the
United States increased again in the 1990s and 2000s as a result of
deteriorating economic conditions, natural disasters (Hurricane
Mitch in 1998 and earthquakes in 2001), and family reunification.
At least 20% of El Salvador's population lives abroad. The
remittances they send home account for close to 20% of GDP, are the
second largest source of external income after exports, and have
helped reduce poverty.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: El Salvador is the smallest
country in central America geographically, it has the fourth
largest economy in the region; the country’s telecom sector has
been restricted by poor infrastructure and unequal income
distribution; there have been organizational delays which have
slowed the development of telecom services; El Salvador’s
fixed-line teledensity is substantially lower than the Latin
American and Caribbean average; there has been a significant drop
in the number of fixed lines since 2010, particularly in 2017,
largely due to the substitution for mobile-only alternatives; about
94% of all telephony lines in the country are on mobile networks;
mobile subscriptions are remarkably high considering El Salvador’s
economic indicators, being about a third higher than average for
Latin America and the Caribbean; the country was one of the last in
the region to provide LTE services, mainly due to the inadequate
provision of suitable spectrum; the multi-spectrum auction
conducted at the end of 2019 has allowed MNOs to improve the reach
and quality of their service offerings; El Salvador’s telecom
legislation is one of the more liberal in Latin America,
encouraging competition in most areas and permitting foreign
investment; there are no regulations which promote wholesale
broadband; the only effective cross-platform competition in the
broadband market comes from the few cable operators; there has been
some market consolidation in recent years (2021)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line services, roughly 14 per 100,
has slowed in the face of mobile-cellular competition now at 153
subscribers per 100 inhabitants (2020)<br/>

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
