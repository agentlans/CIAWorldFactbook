   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">This uninhabited, volcanic, Antarctic island is almost entirely
covered by glaciers making it difficult to approach; it is
recognized as the most remote island on Earth. (It is furthest in
distance from any other point of land, 1,639 km from Antarctica.)
Bouvet Island was discovered in 1739 by a French naval officer
after whom it is named. No claim was made until 1825, when the
British flag was raised. A few expeditions visited the island in
the late 19th century. In 1929, the UK waived its claim in favor of
Norway, which had occupied the island two
years previously. In 1971, Norway designated Bouvet Island and
the adjacent territorial waters a nature reserve. Since 1977,
Norway has run an automated meteorological station and studied
foraging strategies and distribution of fur seals and penguins on
the island. In February 2006, an earthquake weakened the station's
foundation causing it to be blown out to sea in a winter storm.
Norway erected a new research station in 2014 that can hold six
people for periods of two to four months.</subsection>
