   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The archipelago may have been first discovered by Norse
explorers in the 12th century; the islands served as an
international whaling base during the 17th and 18th centuries.
Norway's sovereignty was internationally recognized by treaty in
1920, and five years later it officially took over the territory.
In the 20th century, coal mining started and today a Norwegian and
a Russian company are still functioning. Travel between the
settlements is accomplished with snowmobiles, aircraft, and
boats.</subsection>

negotiations, the two countries signed an agreement in September
2010, defining their maritime boundaries in the Barents Sea and the
Arctic Ocean; the border extends the countries’ land border
northward beyond the islands in the Barents Sea and into the Arctic
Ocean, but the exact distance northward was not specified; because
the area is considered the high seas, the passage of naval and
commercial vessels will be unaffected; once their legislatures
ratify the agreement, both countries will have the green light for
oil and natural gas exploration in their newly defined maritime
areas; Russia objects to Norway’s establishment in 1977 of the
Fishery Protection Zone around the Svalbard Islands, extending
Norwegian sovereignty to the shelf around the archipelago; Svalbard
is strategically important – as a gateway from the Berents Sea to
the North Atlantic – and its waters provide rich fishing
grounds</subsection>
