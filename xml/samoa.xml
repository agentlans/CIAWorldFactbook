   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The first Austronesian settlers arrived in Samoa around 1000
B.C., and early Samoans traded and intermarried with Fijian and
Tongan nobility. The fa’amatai system of titles and nobility
developed, which dominates Samoan politics to this day; all but two
seats in the legislature are reserved for matai, or heads of
families. Dutch explorer Jacob ROGGEVEEN was the first European to
spot the islands in 1722. Christian missionaries arrived in the
1830s, converting most of the population. In the 1850s, Apia became
a center for Pacific trading and hosted an American commercial
agent and British and German consuls. In 1892, American traders
convinced the Samoan king to align his country’s date with the US,
moving to the east of the International Date Line.<br/>
         <br/>
Following the death of the Samoan king in 1841, rival families
competed for his titles, devolving into civil war in 1886 with
factions getting support from either Germany, the UK, or the US.
All three countries sent warships to Apia in 1889, presaging a
larger war, but a cyclone destroyed the ships and Malietoa LAUPEPA
was installed as king. Upon LAUPEPA’s death in 1898, a second civil
war over succession broke out. The war ended in 1899 and the
Western powers abolished the monarchy, giving the western Samoan
islands to Germany and the eastern Samoan islands to the US. The UK
abandoned claims in Samoa and received former German territory in
the Solomon Islands.<br/>
         <br/>
The Mau, a non-violent popular movement to advocate for Samoan
independence, formed in 1908. New Zealand annexed Samoa in 1914
after the outbreak of World War I. Opposition to New Zealand’s rule
quickly grew. In 1918, a New Zealand ship introduced the Spanish
flu, infecting 90% of the population and killing more than 20%. In
1929, New Zealand police shot into a crowd of peaceful protestors,
killing 11, in an event known as Black Sunday. In 1962, Samoa
became the first Polynesian nation to reestablish its independence
as Western Samoa but dropped the “Western” from its name in 1997.
The Human Rights Protection Party has dominated politics since
1982, especially under Prime Minister Sailele TUILAEPA, who has
been in power since 1998.<br/>
         <br/>
In the late 2000s, Samoa began making efforts to align more closely
with Australia and New Zealand. In 2009, Samoa changed its driving
orientation to the left side of the road, in line with other
Commonwealth countries. In 2011, Samoa jumped forward one day -
skipping December 30 - by moving to the west side of the
International Date Line so that it was one hour ahead of New
Zealand and three hours ahead of the east coast of Australia,
rather than 23 and 21 hours behind, respectively.</subsection>

etymology: the meaning of Samoa is disputed; some

alternatively, some assertions state that it can mean "place of the
sacred moa bird" of Polynesian mythology; the name, however, may go
back to Proto-Polynesian (PPn) times (before 1000 B.C.); a
plausible PPn reconstruction has the first syllable as "sa'a"
meaning "tribe or people" and "moa" meaning "deep sea or ocean" to
convey the meaning "people of the deep sea"</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Samoa was one of the first
Pacific Island countries to establish a regulatory infrastructure
and to liberalize its telecom market; the advent of competition in
the mobile market saw prices fall by around 50% and network
coverage increase to more than 90% of the population; Samoa also
boasts one of the highest rates of mobile phone coverage in the
Pacific region; the growth of fixed-line internet has been impeded
by factors including the high costs for bandwidth, under investment
in fixed-line infrastructure; Samoa’s telecoms sector has been
inhibited by a lack of international connectivity; Samoa has had
access to the Samoa-America-Samoa (SAS) cable laid in 2009, this
cable has insufficient capacity to meet the country’s future
bandwidth needs; this issue was addressed with two new submarine
cables that became available in 2018 and 2019; combined with the
Samoa National Broadband Highway (SNBH), have improved internet
data rates and reliability, and have helped to reduce the high
costs previously associated with internet access in Samoa; in April
2022, the Samoan government announced its decision to take over
control of the Samoa Submarine Cable Company, looking to the cable
to generate additional revenue for the state (2022)<br/>

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
