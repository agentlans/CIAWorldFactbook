   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">What is now Ecuador formed part of the northern Inca Empire
until the Spanish conquest in 1533. Quito became a seat of Spanish
colonial government in 1563 and part of the Viceroyalty of New
Granada in 1717. The territories of the Viceroyalty - New Granada
(Colombia), Venezuela, and Quito - gained their independence
between 1819 and 1822 and formed a federation known as Gran
Colombia. When Quito withdrew in 1830, the traditional name was
changed in favor of the "Republic of the Equator." Between 1904 and
1942, Ecuador lost territories in a series of conflicts with its
neighbors. A border war with Peru that flared in 1995 was resolved
in 1999. Although Ecuador marked 30 years of civilian governance in
2004, the period was marred by political instability. Protests in
Quito contributed to the mid-term ouster of three of Ecuador's last
four democratically elected presidents. In late 2008, voters
approved a new constitution, Ecuador's 20th since gaining
independence. Guillermo LASSO was elected president in April 2021
becoming the country's first center-right president in nearly two
decades when he took office the following month.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Ecuador's high poverty and income inequality most affect
indigenous, mixed race, and rural populations. The government has
increased its social spending to ameliorate these problems, but
critics question the efficiency and implementation of its national
development plan. Nevertheless, the conditional cash transfer
program, which requires participants' children to attend school and
have medical check-ups, has helped improve educational attainment
and healthcare among poor children. Ecuador is stalled at above
replacement level fertility and the population most likely will
keep growing rather than stabilize.An estimated 2 to 3 million Ecuadorians live abroad, but
increased unemployment in key receiving countries - Spain, the
United States, and Italy - is slowing emigration and increasing the
likelihood of returnees to Ecuador. The first large-scale
emigration of Ecuadorians occurred between 1980 and 2000, when an
economic crisis drove Ecuadorians from southern provinces to New
York City, where they had trade contacts. A second, nationwide wave
of emigration in the late 1990s was caused by another economic
downturn, political instability, and a currency crisis. Spain was
the logical destination because of its shared language and the wide
availability of low-skilled, informal jobs at a time when increased
border surveillance made illegal migration to the US difficult.
Ecuador has a small but growing immigrant population and is Latin
America's top recipient of refugees; 98% are neighboring Colombians
fleeing violence in their country.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">Ecuador has a small telecom market dominated by the mobile sector; the evolution of the market has been influenced by the poor fixed-line infrastructure, which has stymied the development of fixed-line broadband services; to some extent poor infrastructure has been the result of topographical challenges which have rendered the cost of deploying networks to remote and mountainous areas prohibitive; although Ecuador has several fixed-line operators and a large number of ISPs, the state-owned incumbent leads the fixed-line market, and thus also the fixed broadband market; thus far the MVNO sector has been slow to develop, partly because the incumbent operators also have their low-cost brands and thus there is little business case for new market entrants; the government is keen to advance and improve teledensity; from 2022, additional revenue will be earmarked for programs aimed at expanding the reach of internet and mobile services in rural areas of the country; Ecuador lacks a national 5G roadmap; the mobile operators have conducted several 5G pilots, but no progress has been made on allocation spectrum for 5G, or on developing strategies to encourage investment in the sector (2022)</note>
         <note title="domestic">according to 2021 statistics from the Ministry of Telecommunications and Information Society, 50 percent of Ecuadorian homes do not have access to fixed internet; Ecuador’s telecoms regulator is currently evaluating and reorganizing the 3.5GHz, 2.5 GHz, 700 MHz and AWS spectrum for future government tenders; 2G/3G technologies have a 91.11 percent of penetration and 4G technologies has 60.74 percent (2021); fixed-line teledensity is about 12 per 100 persons; mobile-cellular service with a subscribership of nearly 88 per 100 persons (2021)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>

      <subsection title="Military - note">border conflicts with Peru dominated the military’s focus until
the late 1990s; as of 2023, border security remained a priority,
but in more recent years, security challenges have shifted towards
counterinsurgency and counter-narcotics operations, particularly in
the northern border area where violence and other criminal activity
related to terrorism, insurgency, and narco-trafficking in
Colombia, as well as refugees from Venezuela, has spilled over the
border; troop deployments along the border with Colombia were
scaled back following the 2016 signing of a peace agreement between
the Colombian Government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC) terrorist group (see Appendix
T), but recent violence associated with FARC dissidents to the
agreement have led Ecuador and Colombia to reinforce their shared
border; since 2012, the Ecuadorian Government has also expanded the
military’s role in general public security and counter-narcotics
operations, in part due to rising violence, police corruption, and
police ineffectivenessthe military has had a large role in Ecuador’s political
history; it ruled the country from 1963-1966 and 1972-1979, and
supported a dictatorship in 1970-1972; during the 1980s, the
military remained loyal to the civilian government, but
civilian-military relations were at times tenuous, and the military
had considerable autonomy from civilian oversight; it was involved
in coup attempts in 2000 and 2010</subsection>

cargoes stolen; there has been a slight decrease with four attacks
reported in 2021 and five in 2020; one ship was boarded while
underway and two ships were fired upon</subsection>
