   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The first humans arrived in Tonga around 1000 B.C. The islands’
politics were probably highly centralized under the Tu’i Tonga, or
Tongan king, by A.D. 950, and by 1200, the Tu’i Tonga had expanded
his influence throughout Polynesia and into Melanesia and
Micronesia. The Tongan Empire began to decline in the 1300s,
descending into civil wars, a military defeat to Samoa, and
internal political strife that saw successive leaders assassinated.
By the mid-1500s, some Tu’i Tongans were ethnic Samoan and
day-to-day administration of Tonga was transferred to a new
position occupied by ethnic Tongans.

Dutch sailors explored the islands in the 1600s and British Captain
James COOK visited Tonga three times in the 1770s, naming them the
Friendly Islands for the positive reception he thought he received,
even though the Tongans he encountered were plotting ways to kill
him. In 1799, Tonga fell into a new round of civil wars over
succession. Wesleyan missionaries arrived in 1822, quickly
converting the population. In the 1830s, a low-ranking chief from
Ha’apai began to consolidate control over the islands and won the
support of the missionaries by declaring that he would dedicate
Tonga to God. The chief soon made alliances with leaders on most of
the other islands and was crowned King George TUPOU I in 1845,
establishing the only still-extant Polynesian monarchy. TUPOU I
declared Tonga a constitutional monarchy in 1875 and his successor,
King George TUPOU II, agreed to enter a protectorate agreement with
the UK in 1900 after rival Tongan chiefs tried to overthrow him. As
a protectorate, Tonga never completely lost its indigenous
governance, but it did become more isolated and the social
hierarchy became more stratified between a group of nobles and a
large class of commoners. Today, about one third of parliamentary
seats are reserved for nobles.

Queen Salote TUPOU III negotiated the end of the protectorate in
1965, which was achieved under King TUPOU IV, who in 1970 withdrew
from the protectorate and joined the Commonwealth of Nations. A
prodemocracy movement gained steam in the early 2000s, led by
future Prime Minister ‘Akilisi POHIVA, and in 2006, riots broke out
in Nuku’alofa to protest the lack of progress on prodemocracy
legislation. To appease the activists, in 2008, King George TUPOU V
announced he was relinquishing most of his powers leading up to
parliamentary elections in 2010; he died in 2012 and was succeeded
by his brother ‘Aho’eitu TUPOU VI. Tropical Cyclone Gita, the
strongest-ever recorded storm to impact Tonga, hit the islands in
February 2018 causing extensive damage.</subsection>
