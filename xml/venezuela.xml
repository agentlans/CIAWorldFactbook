   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Venezuela was one of three countries that emerged from the
collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others being Ecuador and New
Granada, which became Colombia). For most of the first half of the
20th century, Venezuela was ruled by military strongmen who
promoted the oil industry and allowed for some social reforms.
Although democratically elected governments largely held sway since
1959, the executive branch under Hugo CHAVEZ, president from 1999
to 2013, exercised increasingly authoritarian control over other
branches of government.  This undemocratic trend continued in
2018 when Nicolas MADURO claimed the presidency for his second term
in an election boycotted by most opposition parties and widely
viewed as fraudulent.

The last democratically-elected institution is the 2015 National
Assembly. The president of the 2015 National Assembly, Juan GUAIDO
is currently recognized by several countries - including the United
States - as the interim president of Venezuela, while MADURO is
recognized by most countries. In 2020, legislative elections were
held for a new National Assembly, which the opposition boycotted
and which were widely condemned as fraudulent. The resulting
assembly is viewed by GUAIDO, most opposition parties, and many
international actors as illegitimate. In November 2021, most
opposition parties broke a three-year election boycott to
participate in mayoral and gubernatorial elections, despite flawed
conditions. As a result, the opposition more than doubled its
representation at the mayoral level and retained four of 23
governorships. The 2021 regional elections marked the first time
since 2006 that the EU was allowed to send an electoral observation
mission to Venezuela.

The MADURO regime places strong restrictions on freedoms of
expression and the press. Since CHAVEZ, the ruling party's economic
policies expanded the state's role in the economy through
expropriations of major enterprises, strict currency exchange and
price controls that discourage private sector investment and
production, and overdependence on the petroleum industry for
revenues, among others. Years of economic mismanagement left
Venezuela ill-prepared to weather the global drop in oil prices in
2014, sparking an economic decline that has resulted in reduced
government social spending, shortages of basic goods, and high
inflation. Worsened living conditions have prompted over 6 million
Venezuelans to migrate, mainly settling in nearby countries. Since
2017, the US has imposed financial and sectoral sanctions on the
MADURO regime. Since mid-2020, and despite MADURO regime
mismanagement and faltering infrastructure, oil production has
begun to rise primarily due to strengthened MADURO regime trade
relations with China, Russia, Iran, and the illicit oil trade.
Caracas has more recently relaxed some economic controls to
mitigate the impact of its sustained economic crisis, such as
allowing increased currency and liberalizing import flexibility for
private citizens and companies. Other concerns include human rights
abuses, rampant violent crime, political manipulation of the
judicial and electoral systems, and corruption.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Social investment in Venezuela during the CHAVEZ administration
reduced poverty from nearly 50% in 1999 to about 27% in 2011,
increased school enrollment, substantially decreased infant and
child mortality, and improved access to potable water and
sanitation through social investment. "Missions" dedicated to
education, nutrition, healthcare, and sanitation were funded
through petroleum revenues. The sustainability of this progress
remains questionable, however, as the continuation of these social
programs depends on the prosperity of Venezuela's oil industry. In
the long-term, education and health care spending may increase
economic growth and reduce income inequality, but rising costs and
the staffing of new health care jobs with foreigners are slowing
development.While CHAVEZ was in power, more than one million predominantly
middle- and upper-class Venezuelans are estimated to have
emigrated. The brain drain is attributed to a repressive political
system, lack of economic opportunities, steep inflation, a high
crime rate, and corruption. Thousands of oil engineers emigrated to
Canada, Colombia, and the United States following CHAVEZ's firing
of over 20,000 employees of the state-owned petroleum company
during a 2002-03 oil strike. Additionally, thousands of Venezuelans
of European descent have taken up residence in their ancestral
homelands. Nevertheless, Venezuela has attracted hundreds of
thousands of immigrants from South America and southern Europe
because of its lenient migration policy and the availability of
education and health care. Venezuela also has been a fairly
accommodating host to Colombian refugees, numbering about 170,000
as of year-end 2016. However, since 2014, falling oil prices have
driven a major economic crisis that has pushed Venezuelans from all
walks of life to migrate or to seek asylum abroad to escape severe
shortages of food, water, and medicine; soaring inflation;
unemployment; and violence. As of September 2022, an estimated 7.1
million Venezuelans were refugees or migrants worldwide, with
almost 80% taking refuge in Latin America and the Caribbean
(notably Colombia, Peru, Chile, Ecuador, Argentina, and Brazil, as
well as the Dominican Republic, Aruba, and Curacao). Asylum
applications increased significantly in the US and Brazil in 2016
and 2017. Several receiving countries are making efforts to
increase immigration restrictions and to deport illegal Venezuelan
migrants - Ecuador and Peru in August 2018 began requiring valid
passports for entry, which are difficult to obtain for Venezuelans.
Nevertheless, Venezuelans continue to migrate to avoid economic
collapse at home.</subsection>

up in 1830; yellow is interpreted as standing for the riches of the
land, blue for the courage of its people, and red for the blood
shed in attaining independence; the seven stars on the original
flag represented the seven provinces in Venezuela that united in
the war of independence; in 2006, then President Hugo CHAVEZ
ordered an eighth star added to the star arc - a decision that
sparked much controversy - to conform with the flag proclaimed by
Simon Bolivar in 1827 and to represent the historic province of

         <note title="general assessment">Venezuela’s fixed-line teledensity was relatively high for the region before the steady growth in the number of lines came to an end in 2015; since then, the number of lines has plummeted, and by late 2021 teledensity had fallen to about 17.3%; the cause is largely linked to the country’s ongoing economic troubles, which have compelled many people to terminate fixed-line telecom services and others still to flee the country; these pressures have also distorted sector revenue and have placed into disarray operators’ investment plans aimed at improving networks and expanding the reach and capabilities of new technologies and services; the fixed broadband penetration rate is lower than the regional average, while data speeds are also relatively low; there is no effective competition in the provision of DSL, and as a result the state-owned incumbent CANTV has had little incentive to improve services from its meager revenue streams; mobile penetration in Venezuela is also below the regional average; the number of mobile subscribers fell by an estimated 2.4% in 2020, year-on-year, as subscribers terminated services in a bid to reduce discretionary spending, this decline is expected to continue into 2022, with subscriber growth not returning until 2023 (2021)</note>
         <note title="domestic">two domestic satellite systems with three earth stations; recent substantial improvement in telephone service in rural areas; 3 major providers operate in the mobile market and compete with state-owned company; fixed-line over 18 per 100 and mobile-cellular telephone subscribership about 63 per 100 persons (2020)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>

boundary and Venezuelan administered Los Monjes Islands near the
Gulf of Venezuela; Colombian-organized illegal narcotics and
paramilitary activities penetrate Venezuela's shared border region;
the border between the two countries was closed from March 2020 to
October 2021 due to COVID, but goods and people fleeing poverty and
violence continued to be smuggled from Venezuela into Colombia, and
illegal narcotics and armed men flowed into Venezuela from
Colombia; since the FARC disarmed in 2016, some former members have
formed armed dissident groups that operate along the borderVenezuela-Guyana: claims all of the area west of the
Essequibo River in Guyana, preventing any discussion of a maritime
boundary; Guyana has expressed its intention to join Barbados in
asserting claims before the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea
that Trinidad and Tobago's maritime boundary with Venezuela extends
into their waters; in 2018, Guyana initiated proceedings against
Venezuela with the International Court of Justice (ICJ); Venezuela
requested a direct dialogue to settle the dispute; the ICJ ruled
that it had jurisdiction to hear the case in December 2020; in
September 2021, Venezuelan officials issued a statement reasserting
dominion over three-quarters of Guyana, which Guyana stated was a
threat to its sovereignty and territorial integrityVenezuela-various:  Venezuela claims Aves Island
and thereby an economic exclusion Zone/continental shelf extending
over a large portion of the eastern Caribbean Sea; Venezuela’s
claim to Aves Island is disputed by Dominica and several other

         <note title="tier rating">Tier 3 — Venezuela does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so; the government created a specialized prosecutor’s office to oversee trafficking investigations and prosecutions; authorities began legal proceedings against three complicit officials in a notable case; however, the government did not assist any victims or investigate, prosecute, or convict any traffickers; little effort was made to curb the forced recruitment of Venezuelan children by Colombian armed groups operating illegally in Venezuela; authorities made little effort to screen Cuban medical professionals for trafficking indicators as the Cuban Government may have forced them to work by withholding their documentation, and coercing them to falsify medical records (2020)</note>
         <note title="trafficking profile">Venezuela is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor; Venezuelan women and girls are trafficked within the country for sexual exploitation, lured from the nation's interior to urban and tourist areas; women from Colombia, Peru, Haiti, China, and South Africa are also reported to have been sexually exploited in Venezuela; some Venezuelan women are transported to Caribbean islands, particularly Aruba, Curacao, and Trinidad &amp; Tobago, where they are subjected to forced prostitution; some Venezuelan children are forced to beg on the streets or work as domestic servants, while Ecuadorian children, often from indigenous communities, are subjected to forced labor; the government provided support to FARC dissidents and the ELN, which grew through the recruitment of child soldiers and exploitation of children in sex trafficking and forced labor; Illegal armed groups lure children in vulnerable conditions and dire economic circumstances with gifts and promises of basic sustenance to later recruit them into their ranks</note>
