   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">China's historical civilization dates to at least 13th century
B.C., first under the Shang (to 1046 B.C.) and then the Zhou
(1046-221 B.C) dynasties. The imperial era of China began in 221
B.C. under the Qin Dynasty and lasted until the fall of the Qing
Dynasty in 1912. During this period, China alternated between
periods of unity and disunity under a succession of imperial
dynasties. In the 19th century, the Qing Dynasty
suffered heavily from overextension by territorial conquest,
insolvency, civil war, imperialism, military defeats, and foreign
expropriation of ports and infrastructure. It collapsed following
the Revolution of 1911, and China became a republic under SUN
Yat-sen of the Kuomintang (KMT or Nationalist) Party. However, the
republic was beset by division, warlordism, and continued foreign
intervention. In the late 1920s, a civil war erupted between the
ruling KMT-controlled government led by CHIANG Kai-shek, and the
Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Japan occupied much of northeastern
China in the early 1930s, and then launched a full-scale invasion
of the country in 1937. The resulting eight years of warfare
devastated the country and cost up to 20 million Chinese lives by
the time of Japan’s defeat in 1945. The Nationalist-Communist civil
war continued with renewed intensity following the end of World War
II and culminated with a CCP victory in 1949, under the leadership
of MAO Zedong.<br/>
         <br/>
MAO and the CCP established an autocratic socialist system that,
while ensuring the PRC's sovereignty, imposed strict controls over
everyday life and launched agricultural, economic, political, and
social policies - such as the Great Leap Forward (1958-1962) and
the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) - that cost the lives of
millions of people. MAO died in 1976. Beginning in 1978, subsequent
leaders DENG Xiaoping, JIANG Zemin, and HU Jintao focused on
market-oriented economic development and opening up the country to
foreign trade, while maintaining the rule of the CCP. Since the
change, China has been among the world’s fastest growing economies,
with real gross domestic product averaging over 9% growth annually
through 2021, lifting an estimated 800 million people out of
poverty, and dramatically improving overall living standards. By
2011, the PRC’s economy was the second largest in the world. The
growth, however, has created considerable social displacement,
adversely affected the country’s environment, and reduced the
country’s natural resources. Current leader XI Jinping has
continued these policies, but also has maintained tight political
controls. Over the past decade, China has also increased its global
outreach, including military deployments, participation in
international organizations, and initiating a global connectivity
initiative in 2013 called the "Belt and Road Initiative" (BRI).
While many nations have signed on to BRI agreements to attract PRC
investment, others have balked at the opaque lending behavior; weak
environment, social, and governance (ESG) standards; and other
practices that undermine local governance and foster corruption
associated with some BRI-linked projects. XI Jinping assumed the
positions of General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and
Chairman of the Central Military Commission in 2012 and President
in 2013. In March 2018, the PRC’s National People’s Congress passed
an amendment abolishing presidential term limits, opening the door
for XI to seek a third five-year term in 2023. </subsection>

the MSS is the PRC’s main civilian intelligence and

the PAP is a paramilitary component (or adjunct) of the PLA; its
primary missions include internal security, maintaining public
order, maritime security, and assisting the PLA in times of war; it
is under the command of the Central Military Commission (CMC); the
China Coast Guard (CCG) administratively falls under the PAP; the
CCG has a variety of missions, such as maritime sovereignty

it is distinct from the PLA’s reserve forces; militia units are
organized around towns, villages, urban sub-districts, and
enterprises, and vary widely in composition and mission; they have
dual civilian-military command structures; a key component of the
militia are the local maritime forces, commonly referred to as the
People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia (PAFMM); the PAFMM consists
of mariners (and their vessels) who receive training, equipment,
and other forms of support from the Navy and CCG (although the
PAFMM remains separate from both) to perform tasks such as maritime
patrolling, surveillance and reconnaissance, emergency/disaster
response, transportation, search and rescue, and auxiliary tasks in

Pakistan's 1964 ceding to China of the Aksai Chin, a territory
designated as part of the princely state of Kashmir by the British
Survey of India in 1865; China claims most of the Indian state
Arunachal Pradesh to the base of the Himalayas, but the US
recognizes the state of Arunachal Pradesh as Indian territory;
Bhutan and China continue negotiations to establish a common
boundary alignment to resolve territorial disputes arising from
substantial cartographic discrepancies, the most contentious of
which lie in Bhutan's west along China's Chumbi salient; Chinese
maps show an international boundary symbol (the so-called
“nine-dash line”) off the coasts of the littoral states of the
South China Sea, where China has interrupted Vietnamese hydrocarbon
exploration; China asserts sovereignty over Scarborough Reef along
with the Philippines and Taiwan, and over the Spratly Islands
together with Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Vietnam, and
Brunei; the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South
China Sea eased tensions in the Spratlys, and in 2017 China
and ASEAN began confidential negotiations for an updated Code of
Conduct for the South China Sea designed not to settle territorial
disputes but establish rules and norms in the region; this still
is not the legally binding code of conduct sought by some
parties; Vietnam and China continue to expand construction of
facilities in the Spratlys and in early 2018 China began deploying
advanced military systems to disputed Spratly outposts; China
occupies some of the Paracel Islands also claimed by Vietnam and
Taiwan; the Japanese-administered Senkaku Islands are also claimed
by China and Taiwan; certain islands in the Yalu and Tumen Rivers
are in dispute with North Korea; North Korea and China seek to stem
illegal migration to China by North Koreans, fleeing privation and
oppression; China and Russia have demarcated the once disputed
islands at the Amur and Ussuri confluence and in the Argun River in
accordance with their 2004 Agreement; China and Tajikistan have
begun demarcating the revised boundary agreed to in the
delimitation of 2002; the decade-long demarcation of the
China-Vietnam land boundary was completed in 2009; citing
environmental, cultural, and social concerns, China has

Tier 3; the government initiated its first prosecution of a
domestic trafficking case, approved a new National Action Plan for
2021-2030, and conducted some anti-trafficking training; however,
there was a government policy or pattern of widespread forced
labor, including continued mass arbitrary detention of Uyghurs,
ethnic Kazakhs, ethnic Kyrgyz, and members of other Turkic and
Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region; the
government also implemented similar policies against other
religious minorities and Tibetans in other provinces; Chinese
nationals reportedly suffered forced labor in several countries in
Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Europe hosting Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI) projects; for the fifth consecutive year, the
government did not report complete law enforcement data, nor did it
identify any trafficking victims or refer them to protection
services  (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
trafficking profile: human traffickers exploit
domestic and foreign victims in China and Chinese people abroad;
Chinese men, women, and children are victims of forced labor and
sex trafficking in at least 60 countries; traffickers also use
China as a transit point to subject foreign individuals to
trafficking in other countries throughout Asia and in international
maritime industries; state-sponsored forced labor is intensifying
under the government’s mass detention and political indoctrination
campaign against Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur
Autonomous Region; well-organized criminal syndicates and local
gangs subject Chinese women and girls to sex trafficking within
China; women and girls from South Asia, Southeast Asia, and several
countries in Africa experience forced labor in domestic service,
forced concubinism leading to forced childbearing, and sex
trafficking via forced and fraudulent marriage to Chinese men;
