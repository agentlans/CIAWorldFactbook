   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Finland was a province and then a grand duchy under Sweden from
the 12th to the 19th centuries, and an autonomous grand duchy of
Russia after 1809. It gained complete independence in 1917. During
World War II, Finland successfully defended its independence
through cooperation with Germany and resisted subsequent invasions
by the Soviet Union - albeit with some loss of territory. In the
subsequent half century, Finland transformed from a farm/forest
economy to a diversified modern industrial economy; per capita
income is among the highest in Western Europe. A member of the EU
since 1995, Finland was the only Nordic state to join the euro
single currency at its initiation in January 1999. In the 21st
century, the key features of Finland's modern welfare state are
high quality education, promotion of equality, and a national
social welfare system - currently challenged by an aging population
and the fluctuations of an export-driven economy.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Finland’s telecom market is
among the more progressive in Europe, with operators having been at
the forefront in deploying technologies and with the regulator
being among the first to auction spectrum for 5G use; these efforts
have been supported by the government which is working towards its
target of providing a broadband service of at least 100Mb/s by
2025; 5G services were available to more than 40% of the population
by early 2021, and take-up among subscribers has been strong
although most will remain with LTE in the short term; the country
enjoys one of the highest broadband and mobile subscription rates
in the region, with customers able to make use of the latest
iterations of technologies including DOCSIS3.1, LTE-A, 5G, and GPON
fiber infrastructure; Finland has emerged as one of the pioneers in
5G; the auction of spectrum in the 700MHz and 3.5GHh bands has
enabled network operators to extend the availability of LTE
services nationally and to prepare for 5G services; Spectrum in the
2.5GHz band was auctioned in mid-2020 and has since enabled the
MNOs to widen their 5G footprint considerably; there is an ongoing
shift away from DSL to fiber and mobile networks (2021)<br/>

access to Intelsat transmission service via a Swedish satellite
earth station, 1 Inmarsat (Atlantic and Indian Ocean regions); note
- Finland shares the Inmarsat earth station with the other Nordic
countries (Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) (2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
