   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Once the seat of Viking raiders and later a major north European
power, Denmark has evolved into a modern, prosperous nation that is
participating in the general political and economic integration of
Europe. It joined NATO in 1949 and the EEC (now the EU) in 1973.
However, the country has opted out of certain elements of the EU's
Maastricht Treaty, including the European Economic and Monetary
Union, European defense cooperation, and justice and home affairs
issues.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Flag description">red with a white cross that extends to the edges of the flag;
the vertical part of the cross is shifted to the hoist side; the
banner is referred to as the Dannebrog (Danish flag) and is one of
the oldest national flags in the world; traditions as to the origin
of the flag design vary, but the best known is a legend that the
banner fell from the sky during an early-13th century battle;
caught up by the Danish king before it ever touched the earth, this
heavenly talisman inspired the royal army to victory; in actuality,
the flag may derive from a crusade banner or ensign<br/>
         <br/>
note: the shifted cross design element was
subsequently adopted by the other Nordic countries of Finland,
Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, as well as by the Faroe Islands</subsection>

Lovely Country); "Kong Christian" (King Christian)<br/>
         <br/>
lyrics/music: Adam Gottlob OEHLENSCHLAGER/Hans
Ernst KROYER; Johannes EWALD/unknown<br/>
         <br/>
note: Denmark has two national anthems with equal
status; "Der er et yndigt land," adopted 1844, is a national
anthem, while "Kong Christian," adopted 1780, serves as both a
national and royal anthem; "Kong Christian" is also known as "Kong
Christian stod ved hojen mast" (King Christian Stood by the Lofty
Mast) and "Kongesangen" (The King's Anthem); within Denmark, the
royal anthem is played only when royalty is present and is usually
followed by the national anthem; when royalty is not present, only
the national anthem is performed; outside Denmark, the royal anthem
is played, unless the national anthem is requested</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Denmark has one of the
highest broadband subscription rates globally, with a near
universal availability of super-fast connections; extensive cable
and DSL infrastructure has been supported by a progressive
regulatory regime which has encouraged operator access to both
copper and fiber networks; fiber networks have a fast-growing
footprint, while a number of community and metropolitan schemes
have supplemented their own commitments to build out fiber
nationally; a number of wholesale fiber schemes have also added to
the wider availability of fiber broadband; the reach of LTE
infrastructure is comprehensive, while the Mobile Network Operators
by mid-2021 had also provided about 90% population coverage with
5G; services based on 5G were initially launched using trial 3.5GHz
licenses; the multi-spectrum auction held in April 2021 has enabled
them to improve the resilience and capacity of 5G; all MNOs are
engaged in closing down their 3G networks and repurposing spectrum
for LTE and 5G use (2021)<br/>

note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
