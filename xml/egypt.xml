   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The regularity and richness of the annual Nile River flood,
coupled with semi-isolation provided by deserts to the east and
west, allowed for the development of one of the world's great
civilizations. A unified kingdom arose circa 3200 B.C., and a
series of dynasties ruled in Egypt for the next three millennia.
The last native dynasty fell to the Persians in 341 B.C., who in
turn were replaced by the Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines. It was
the Arabs who introduced Islam and the Arabic language in the 7th
century and who ruled for the next six centuries. A local military
caste, the Mamluks took control about 1250 and continued to govern
after the conquest of Egypt by the Ottoman Turks in 1517.
Completion of the Suez Canal in 1869 elevated Egypt as an important
world transportation hub. Ostensibly to protect its investments,
Britain seized control of Egypt's government in 1882, but nominal
allegiance to the Ottoman Empire continued until 1914. Partially
independent from the UK in 1922, Egypt acquired full sovereignty
from Britain in 1952. The completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1971
and the resultant Lake Nasser have reaffirmed the time-honored
place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A
rapidly growing population (the largest in the Arab world), limited
arable land, and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax
resources and stress society. The government has struggled to meet
the demands of Egypt's fast-growing population as it implements
large-scale infrastructure projects, energy cooperation, and
foreign direct investment appeals.Inspired by the 2010 Tunisian revolution, Egyptian opposition
groups led demonstrations and labor strikes countrywide,
culminating in President Hosni MUBARAK's ouster in 2011. Egypt's
military assumed national leadership until a new legislature was in
place in early 2012; later that same year, Muhammad MURSI won the
presidential election. Following protests throughout the spring of
2013 against MURSI's government and the Muslim Brotherhood, the
Egyptian Armed Forces intervened and removed MURSI from power in
July 2013 and replaced him with interim president Adly MANSOUR.
Simultaneously, the government began enacting laws to limit
freedoms of assembly and expression. In January 2014, voters
approved a new constitution by referendum and in May 2014 elected
former defense minister Abdelfattah ELSISI president. Egypt elected
a new legislature in December 2015, its first House of
Representatives since 2012. ELSISI was reelected to a second
four-year term in March 2018. In April 2019, Egypt approved via
national referendum a set of constitutional amendments extending
ELSISI’s term in office through 2024 and possibly through 2030 if
reelected for a third term. The amendments would also allow future
presidents up to two consecutive six-year terms in office,
reestablish an upper legislative house, allow for one or more vice
presidents, establish a 25% quota for female legislators, reaffirm
the military’s role as guardian of Egypt, and expand presidential
authority to appoint the heads of judicial councils. Successful
legislative elections were held in October-November 2020, having
been delayed for six months.  </subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Egypt is the most populous country in the Arab world and the
third-most-populous country in Africa, behind Nigeria and Ethiopia.
Most of the country is desert, so about 95% of the population is
concentrated in a narrow strip of fertile land along the Nile
River, which represents only about 5% of Egypt’s land area. Egypt’s
rapid population growth – 46% between 1994 and 2014 – stresses
limited natural resources, jobs, housing, sanitation, education,
and health care.Although the country’s total fertility rate (TFR) fell from
roughly 5.5 children per woman in 1980 to just over 3 in the late
1990s, largely as a result of state-sponsored family planning
programs, the population growth rate dropped more modestly because
of decreased mortality rates and longer life expectancies. During
the last decade, Egypt’s TFR decline stalled for several years and
then reversed, reaching 3.6 in 2011, and is under 3 as of 2022.
Contraceptive use has held steady at about 60%, while preferences
for larger families and early marriage may have strengthened in the
wake of the recent 2011 revolution. The large cohort of women of or
nearing childbearing age will sustain high population growth for
the foreseeable future (an effect called population momentum).Nevertheless, post-MUBARAK governments have not made curbing
population growth a priority. To increase contraceptive use and to
prevent further overpopulation will require greater government
commitment and substantial social change, including encouraging
smaller families and better educating and empowering women.
Currently, literacy, educational attainment, and labor force
participation rates are much lower for women than men. In addition,
the prevalence of violence against women, the lack of female
political representation, and the perpetuation of the nearly
universal practice of female genital cutting continue to keep women
from playing a more significant role in Egypt’s public sphere.Population pressure, poverty, high unemployment, and the
fragmentation of inherited land holdings have historically
motivated Egyptians, primarily young men, to migrate internally
from rural and smaller urban areas in the Nile Delta region and the
poorer rural south to Cairo, Alexandria, and other urban centers in
the north, while a much smaller number migrated to the Red Sea and
Sinai areas. Waves of forced internal migration also resulted from
the 1967 Arab-Israeli War and the floods caused by the completion
of the Aswan High Dam in 1970. Limited numbers of students and
professionals emigrated temporarily prior to the early 1970s, when
economic problems and high unemployment pushed the Egyptian
Government to lift restrictions on labor migration. At the same
time, high oil revenues enabled Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and other Gulf
states, as well as Libya and Jordan, to fund development projects,
creating a demand for unskilled labor (mainly in construction),
which attracted tens of thousands of young Egyptian men.Between 1970 and 1974 alone, Egyptian migrants in the Gulf
countries increased from approximately 70,000 to 370,000. Egyptian
officials encouraged legal labor migration both to alleviate
unemployment and to generate remittance income (remittances
continue to be one of Egypt’s largest sources of foreign currency
and GDP). During the mid-1980s, however, depressed oil prices
resulting from the Iran-Iraq War, decreased demand for low-skilled
labor, competition from less costly South Asian workers, and
efforts to replace foreign workers with locals significantly
reduced Egyptian migration to the Gulf States. The number of
Egyptian migrants dropped from a peak of almost 3.3 million in 1983
to about 2.2 million at the start of the 1990s, but numbers
gradually recovered.In the 2000s, Egypt began facilitating more labor migration
through bilateral agreements, notably with Arab countries and
Italy, but illegal migration to Europe through overstayed visas or
maritime human smuggling via Libya also rose. The Egyptian
Government estimated there were 6.5 million Egyptian migrants in
2009, with roughly 75% being temporary migrants in other Arab
countries (Libya, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kuwait, and the United Arab
Emirates) and 25% being predominantly permanent migrants in the
West (US, UK, Italy, France, and Canada).During the 2000s, Egypt became an increasingly important transit
and destination country for economic migrants and asylum seekers,
including Palestinians, East Africans, and South Asians and, more
recently, Iraqis and Syrians. Egypt draws many refugees because of
its resettlement programs with the West; Cairo has one of the
largest urban refugee populations in the world. Many East African
migrants are interned or live in temporary encampments along the
Egypt-Israel border, and some have been shot and killed by Egyptian
border guards.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">Egypt’s large telecom market is supported by a population of about 108 million and benefits from effective competition in most sectors; a liberal regulatory regime allows for unified licenses which permit operators to offer fixed-line as well as mobile services; in recent years the government has developed a number of digital migration projects aimed at increasing average broadband speeds, delivering fiber broadband to about 60% of the population, developing an in-house satellite program, and creating a knowledge-based economy through the greater adoption of ICTs; the New Administrative Capital being built is only one of more than a dozen smart city projects, which together are stimulating investment in 5G and fiber broadband, as well as the adoption of IoT and AI solutions; the country endeavors to be a significant ICT hub in the North Africa and Middle East regions; Egypt’s mature mobile market has one of the highest subscription rates in Africa; progress in the adoption of mobile data services has been hampered by the lack of sufficient spectrum; the regulator in September 2020 made available 60MHz in the 2.6GHz band, though the spectrum was not allocated until late 2021; the additional spectrum will go far to enabling the MNOs to improve the quality of mobile broadband services offered; further 5G trials are to be held later in 2022, focused on the New Administrative Capital; the international cable infrastructure remains an important asset for Egypt, which benefits from its geographical position; Telecom Egypt has become one of the largest concerns in this segment, being a participating member in numerous cable systems; in mid-2021 the telco announced plans to build the Hybrid African Ring Path system, connecting a number of landlocked countries in Africa with Italy, France, and Portugal; the system will partly use the company’s existing terrestrial and sub sea cable networks (2022)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>

      <subsection title="Military - note">since 2011, the Egyptian Armed Forces, police, and other
security forces have been actively engaged in counterinsurgency and
counter-terrorism operations in the North Sinai governorate against
several militant groups, particularly the Islamic State of Iraq and
ash-Sham – Sinai Province; as of 2022, Egypt had tens of thousands
of military troops, police, and other security personnel deployed
in the Sinai for internal security duties; in addition, tribal
militias were assisting Egyptian security forces

the military has a large stake in the civilian economy, including
running banks, businesses, gas stations, shipping lines, and
utilities, and producing consumer and industrial goods, importing
commodities, and building and managing infrastructure projects,
such as bridges, roads, hospitals, and housing; the various
enterprises are reportedly profitable enough to make the armed
forces largely self-funded

Egypt has Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA) status with the US; MNNA is a
designation under US law that provides foreign partners with
certain benefits in the areas of defense trade and security
cooperation; while MNNA status provides military and economic
privileges, it does not entail any security commitments

the Multinational Force &amp; Observers (MFO) has operated in the
Sinai since 1982 as a peacekeeping and monitoring force to
supervise the implementation of the security provisions of the 1979
Egyptian-Israeli Treaty of Peace; the MFO is an independent
international organization, created by agreement between Egypt and
Israel; as of 2022, it was composed of about 1,150 troops from 13
countries; Colombia, Fiji, and the US were the leading providers of
troops to the MFO (2022)</subsection>
