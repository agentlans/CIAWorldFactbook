   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Paramount chief MOSHOESHOE I consolidated what would become
Basutoland in the early 19th century and made himself king in 1822.
Continuing encroachments by Dutch settlers from the neighboring
Orange Free State caused the king to enter into an 1868 agreement
with the UK by which Basutoland became a British protectorate, and
after 1884, a crown colony. Upon independence in 1966, the country
was renamed the Kingdom of Lesotho. The Basotho National Party
ruled the country during its first two decades. King MOSHOESHOE II
was exiled in 1990, but returned to Lesotho in 1992 and was
reinstated in 1995 and subsequently succeeded by his son, King
LETSIE III, in 1996. Constitutional government was restored in 1993
after seven years of military rule. In 1998, violent protests and a
military mutiny following a contentious election prompted a brief
but bloody intervention by South African and Batswana military
forces under the aegis of the Southern African Development
Community. Subsequent constitutional reforms restored relative
political stability. Peaceful parliamentary elections were held in
2002, but the National Assembly elections in 2007 were hotly
contested and aggrieved parties disputed how the electoral law was
applied to award proportional seats in the Assembly. In 2012,
competitive elections involving 18 parties saw Prime Minister
Motsoahae Thomas THABANE form a coalition government - the first in
the country's history - that ousted the 14-year incumbent,
Pakalitha MOSISILI, who peacefully transferred power the following
month. MOSISILI returned to power in snap elections in February
2015 after the collapse of THABANE’s coalition government and an
alleged attempted military coup. In June 2017, THABANE returned to
become prime minister.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Lesotho faces great socioeconomic challenges. Almost half of its
population lives below the poverty line as of 2017, and the
country’s HIV/AIDS prevalence rate is the second highest in the
world as of 2021. In addition, Lesotho is a small, mountainous,
landlocked country with little arable land, leaving its population
vulnerable to food shortages and reliant on remittances. Lesotho’s
persistently high infant, child, and maternal mortality rates have
been increasing during the last decade, according to the last two
Demographic and Health Surveys. Despite these significant
shortcomings, Lesotho has made good progress in education; it is
on-track to achieve universal primary education and has one of the
highest adult literacy rates in Africa.Lesotho’s migration history is linked to its unique geography;
it is surrounded by South Africa with which it shares linguistic
and cultural traits. Lesotho at one time had more of its workforce
employed outside its borders than any other country. Today
remittances equal about 20% of its GDP. With few job options at
home, a high rate of poverty, and higher wages available across the
border, labor migration to South Africa replaced agriculture as the
prevailing Basotho source of income decades ago. The majority of
Basotho migrants were single men contracted to work as gold miners
in South Africa. However, migration trends changed in the 1990s,
and fewer men found mining jobs in South Africa because of
declining gold prices, stricter immigration policies, and a
preference for South African workers.Although men still dominate cross-border labor migration, more
women are working in South Africa, mostly as domestics, because
they are widows or their husbands are unemployed. Internal
rural-urban flows have also become more frequent, with more women
migrating within the country to take up jobs in the garment
industry or moving to care for loved ones with HIV/AIDS. Lesotho’s
small population of immigrants is increasingly composed of
Taiwanese and Chinese migrants who are involved in the textile
industry and small retail businesses.</subsection>

September 2022; the forecasted proportion translates into 320,000
people in rural areas, while an additional 201,000 people in urban
areas are foreseen to also need assistance; the foreseen increase
of acute food insecurity levels is primarily due to the reduced
harvest, high food prices in basic food and non‑food commodities
and a slow recovery of households’ income reflecting a downturn in
economic growth; harvesting of the 2022 main-season summer cereal
crops, mostly maize and sorghum, is complete; production of maize,
the main cereal staple, is about one‑third of the average, while
the sorghum output is almost negligible; the poor harvest was
primarily due to torrential rainfalls during January and February
2022, which caused localized flooding and resulted in crop losses

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: until late 2020, Lesotho’s
telecom regulator maintained a market duopoly which is focused on
fixed-line services; competition was insufficient to promote
effective price reductions for consumers, while the regulator had
no mechanisms in place to monitor the telcos to ensure quality of
service and fair pricing for consumers; the small size of the
country’s population provided little incentive for new players to
enter the market; a positive outcome for consumers was the
deployment in early 2021 of a service to monitor traffic and
billing; this ended the practice whereby the regulator was
dependent on telcos submitting data about their performance,
billing, and other matters; the regulator has also turned its
attention to addressing multiple SIM ownership and stem incidences
of crimes committed using unregistered SIMs; in May 2022, it
instructed the country’s MNOs to begin registering SIM cards on
their networks from the following month; fixed-wireless 5G trials
began in early 2019 (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line is less than 1 per 100
subscriptions; mobile-cellular service subscribership nearly 73 per
100 persons; rudimentary system consisting of a modest number of
landlines, a small microwave radio relay system, and a small
radiotelephone communication system (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 266; Internet
accessibility has improved with several submarine fiber optic
cables that land on African east and west coasts, but the country's
land locked position makes access prices expensive; satellite earth
station - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) (2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
