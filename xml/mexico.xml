   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The site of several advanced Amerindian civilizations -
including the Olmec, Toltec, Teotihuacan, Zapotec, Maya, and Aztec
- Mexico was conquered and colonized by Spain in the early 16th
century. Administered as the Viceroyalty of New Spain for three
centuries, it achieved independence early in the 19th century.
Elections held in 2000 marked the first time since the 1910 Mexican
Revolution that an opposition candidate - Vicente FOX of the
National Action Party (PAN) - defeated the party in government, the
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). He was succeeded in 2006
by another PAN candidate Felipe CALDERON, but Enrique PEÑA NIETO
regained the presidency for the PRI in 2012. Left-leaning
anti-establishment politician and former mayor of Mexico City
(2000-05) Andrés Manuel LÓPEZ OBRADOR, from the National
Regeneration Movement (MORENA), became president in December
2018.<br/>
         <br/>
The global financial crisis in late 2008 caused a massive economic
downturn in Mexico the following year. Growth rebounded to about 5%
in 2010, but then averaged roughly half that for the rest of the
decade. Notwithstanding this challenge, Mexico is currently the
largest goods trading partner of the US – with $614.5 billion in
two-way goods trade during 2019. US exports of goods and services
to Mexico supported 1.2 million jobs in the US in 2015 (the latest
data available) according to estimates from the Department of
Commerce. Mexico's GDP contracted by 8.2% in 2020 due to
pandemic-induced closures, its lowest level since the Great
Depression, but Mexico’s economy rebounded in 2021 when it grew by
4.8%, driven largely by increased remittances, despite supply chain
and pandemic-related challenges.The US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA, or T-MEC by its Spanish
acronym) entered into force on 1 July 2020 and replaced its
predecessor, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Mexico amended its constitution on 1 May 2019 to facilitate the
implementation of the labor components of USMCA.Ongoing economic and social concerns include low real wages,
high underemployment, inequitable income distribution, and few
advancement opportunities for the largely indigenous population in
the impoverished southern states. Since 2007, Mexico's powerful
transnational criminal organizations have engaged in a struggle to
control criminal markets, resulting in tens of thousands of
drug-related homicides and forced disappearances.</subsection>

California are mostly dormant; Colima (3,850 m), which erupted in
2010, is Mexico's most active volcano and is responsible for
causing periodic evacuations of nearby villagers; it has been
deemed a Decade Volcano by the International Association of
Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior, worthy of study
due to its explosive history and close proximity to human
populations; Popocatepetl (5,426 m) poses a threat to Mexico City;
other historically active volcanoes include Barcena, Ceboruco, El
Chichon, Michoacan-Guanajuato, Pico de Orizaba, San Martin,
Socorro, and Tacana; see note 2 under "Geography - note"</subsection>
      <subsection title="Geography - note">note 1: strategic location on southern border
of the US; Mexico is one of the countries along the Ring of Fire, a
belt of active volcanoes and earthquake epicenters bordering the
Pacific Ocean; up to 90% of the world's earthquakes and some 75% of
the world's volcanoes occur within the Ring of Firenote 2: some of the world's most important food
crops were first domesticated in Mexico; the "Three Sisters"
companion plants - winter squash, maize (corn), and climbing beans
- served as the main agricultural crops for various North American
Indian groups; all three apparently originated in Mexico but then
were widely disseminated through much of North America; avocado,
amaranth, and chili peppers also emanate from Mexico, as does
vanilla, the world's most popular aroma and flavor spice; although
cherry tomatoes originated in Ecuador, their domestication in
Mexico transformed them into the larger modern tomato<br/>
         <br/>
note 3: the Sac Actun cave system at 348 km
(216 mi) is the longest underwater cave in the world and the second
longest cave worldwide, after Mammoth Cave in the United States
(see "Geography - note" under United States)<br/>
         <br/>
note 4: the prominent Yucatán Peninsula that
divides the Gulf of Mexico from the Caribbean Sea is shared by
Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize; just on the northern coast of
Yucatan, near the town of Chicxulub (pronounce cheek-sha-loob), lie
the remnants of a massive crater (some 150 km in diameter and
extending well out into the Gulf of Mexico); formed by an asteroid
or comet when it struck the earth 66 million years ago, the impact
is now widely accepted as initiating a worldwide climate disruption
that caused a mass extinction of 75% of all the earth's plant and
animal species - including the non-avian dinosaurs</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: with a large population and
relatively low broadband and mobile penetration, (86 lines for
mobile broadband for every 100 habitants in June 2021) Mexico’s
telecom sector has potential for growth; adequate telephone service
for business and government; improving quality and increasing
mobile cellular availability, with mobile subscribers far
outnumbering fixed-line subscribers (24.6 million fixed line
subscribers and 125 million mobile line subscribers in June 2021);
relatively low broadband and mobile penetration, potential for
growth and international investment; extensive microwave radio
relay network; considerable use of fiber-optic cable and coaxial
cable; 5G development slow in part due to high costs (2021)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line teledensity exceeds 65 lines
per every 100 households; mobile-cellular teledensity is about 99
per 100 persons; domestic satellite system with 120 earth stations
(2021)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 52; Columbus-2
fiber-optic submarine cable with access to the US, Virgin Islands,
Canary Islands, Spain, and Italy; the ARCOS-1 and the MAYA-1
submarine cable system together provide access to Central America,
parts of South America and the Caribbean, and the U.S.;
Pan-American Crossing (PAC) submarine cable system provides access
to Panama, California, U.S., and Costa Rica; Lazaro
Cardenas-Manzanillo Santiago submarines cable system (LCMSSCS)
provides access to Michoacan, Guerrero, and Colima, Mexico; AMX-1
submarine cable system with access to Colombia, Brazil, Puerto
Rico, Gulf of California Cable submarine cable systems that
connects La Paz, Baja California Sur and Topolobambo, Sinaloa; and
Aurora submarine cable system provides access to Guatemala, Panama,
Ecuador, Colombia, Mexico, and the U.S. satellite earth stations -
124 (36 Intelsat, 1 Solidaridad (giving Mexico improved access to
South America, Central America, and much of the US as well as
enhancing domestic communications), 9 Panamsat, numerous Inmarsat
mobile earth stations); linked to Central American Microwave System
of trunk connections (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

television channels after decades of a quasi-monopoly; Mexico has

owned; the Televisa group once had a virtual monopoly in TV
broadcasting, but new broadcasting groups and foreign satellite and
cable operators are now available; in 2016, Mexico became the first
country in Latin America to complete the transition from analog to
digital transmissions, allowing for better image and audio quality
and a wider selection of programming from networks (2022)</subsection>
