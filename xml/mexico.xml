   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The site of several advanced Amerindian civilizations -
including the Olmec, Toltec, Teotihuacan, Zapotec, Maya, and Aztec
- Mexico was conquered and colonized by Spain in the early 16th
century. Administered as the Viceroyalty of New Spain for three
centuries, it achieved independence early in the 19th century.
Elections held in 2000 marked the first time since the 1910 Mexican
Revolution that an opposition candidate - Vicente FOX of the
National Action Party (PAN) - defeated the party in government, the
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). He was succeeded in 2006
by another PAN candidate Felipe CALDERON, but Enrique PEÑA NIETO
regained the presidency for the PRI in 2012. Left-leaning
anti-establishment politician and former mayor of Mexico City
(2000-05) Andrés Manuel LÓPEZ OBRADOR, from the National
Regeneration Movement (MORENA), became president in December
2018.

The global financial crisis in late 2008 caused a massive economic
downturn in Mexico the following year. Growth rebounded to about 5%
in 2010, but then averaged roughly half that for the rest of the
decade. Notwithstanding this challenge, Mexico is currently the
largest goods trading partner of the US – with $614.5 billion in
two-way goods trade during 2019. US exports of goods and services
to Mexico supported 1.2 million jobs in the US in 2015 (the latest
data available) according to estimates from the Department of
Commerce. Mexico's GDP contracted by 8.2% in 2020 due to
pandemic-induced closures, its lowest level since the Great
Depression, but Mexico’s economy rebounded in 2021 when it grew by
4.8%, driven largely by increased remittances, despite supply chain
and pandemic-related challenges.The US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA, or T-MEC by its Spanish
acronym) entered into force on 1 July 2020 and replaced its
predecessor, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Mexico amended its constitution on 1 May 2019 to facilitate the
implementation of the labor components of USMCA.Ongoing economic and social concerns include low real wages,
high underemployment, inequitable income distribution, and few
advancement opportunities for the largely indigenous population in
the impoverished southern states. Since 2007, Mexico's powerful
transnational criminal organizations have engaged in a struggle to
control criminal markets, resulting in tens of thousands of
drug-related homicides and forced disappearances.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">with a large population and relatively low broadband and mobile penetration, (86 lines for mobile broadband for every 100 habitants in June 2021) Mexico’s telecom sector has potential for growth; adequate telephone service for business and government; improving quality and increasing mobile cellular availability, with mobile subscribers far outnumbering fixed-line subscribers (24.6 million fixed line subscribers and 125 million mobile line subscribers in June 2021); relatively low broadband and mobile penetration, potential for growth and international investment; extensive microwave radio relay network; considerable use of fiber-optic cable and coaxial cable; 5G development slow in part due to high costs (2021)</note>
         <note title="domestic">fixed-line teledensity exceeds 65 lines per every 100 households; mobile-cellular teledensity is about 99 per 100 persons; domestic satellite system with 120 earth stations (2021)</note>
         <note title="international">country code - 52; Columbus-2 fiber-optic submarine cable with access to the US, Virgin Islands, Canary Islands, Spain, and Italy; the ARCOS-1 and the MAYA-1 submarine cable system together provide access to Central America, parts of South America and the Caribbean, and the U.S.; Pan-American Crossing (PAC) submarine cable system provides access to Panama, California, U.S., and Costa Rica; Lazaro Cardenas-Manzanillo Santiago submarines cable system (LCMSSCS) provides access to Michoacan, Guerrero, and Colima, Mexico; AMX-1 submarine cable system with access to Colombia, Brazil, Puerto Rico, Gulf of California Cable submarine cable systems that connects La Paz, Baja California Sur and Topolobambo, Sinaloa; and Aurora submarine cable system provides access to Guatemala, Panama, Ecuador, Colombia, Mexico, and the U.S. satellite earth stations - 124 (36 Intelsat, 1 Solidaridad (giving Mexico improved access to South America, Central America, and much of the US as well as enhancing domestic communications), 9 Panamsat, numerous Inmarsat mobile earth stations); linked to Central American Microwave System of trunk connections (2022)</note>
         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>

      <subsection title="Broadcast media">telecom reform in 2013 enabled the creation of new broadcast
television channels after decades of a quasi-monopoly; Mexico has
885 TV stations and 1,841 radio stations and most are privately
owned; the Televisa group once had a virtual monopoly in TV
broadcasting, but new broadcasting groups and foreign satellite and
cable operators are now available; in 2016, Mexico became the first
country in Latin America to complete the transition from analog to
digital transmissions, allowing for better image and audio quality
and a wider selection of programming from networks (2022)</subsection>
