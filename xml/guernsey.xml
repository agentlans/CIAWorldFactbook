   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Guernsey and the other Channel Islands represent the last
remnants of the medieval Duchy of Normandy, which held sway in both
France and England. The islands were the only British soil occupied
by German troops in World War II. The Bailiwick of Guernsey
consists of the main island of Guernsey and a number of smaller
islands including Alderney, Sark, Herm, Jethou, Brecqhou, and
Lihou. The Bailiwick is a self-governing British Crown dependency
that is not part of the UK. However, the UK Government is
constitutionally responsible for its defense and international
representation.Â </subsection>
