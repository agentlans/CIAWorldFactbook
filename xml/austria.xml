   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Once the center of power for the large Austro-Hungarian Empire,
Austria was reduced to a small republic after its defeat in World
War I. Following annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938 and subsequent
occupation by the victorious Allies in 1945, Austria's status
remained unclear for a decade. A State Treaty signed in 1955 ended
the occupation, recognized Austria's independence, and forbade
unification with Germany. A constitutional law that same year
declared the country's "perpetual neutrality" as a condition for
Soviet military withdrawal. The Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 and
Austria's entry into the EU in 1995 somewhat altered the meaning of
this neutrality. A prosperous, democratic country, Austria entered
the EU Economic and Monetary Union in 1999.</subsection>

etymology: the name Oesterreich means "eastern

Austria is a Latinization of the German name</subsection>

etymology: the origin of the name is disputed but
may derive from early Celtic settlements of the area; a possible
reconstructed Celtic name from several centuries B.C. is Vedunia
(meaning "forest stream"); under Roman settlement, beginning around
15 B.C., the name became Vindobona (likely from the Celtic
windo, meaning "white, fair, or bright" and bona
meaning "base, fortification, or settlement" to give a connotation
of "white settlement" or "white fort"); archeological remains of
the latter survive at many sites in the center of Vienna</subsection>

flag design is certainly one of the oldest - if not the oldest -
national banners in the world; according to tradition, in 1191,
following a fierce battle in the Third Crusade, Duke Leopold V of
Austria's white tunic became completely blood-spattered; upon
removal of his wide belt or sash, a white band was revealed; the
red-white-red color combination was subsequently adopted as his
banner</subsection>

note 1: adopted 1947; the anthem is also known as
"Land der Berge, Land am Strome" (Land of the Mountains, Land by
the River); Austria adopted a new national anthem after World War
II to replace the former imperial anthem composed by Franz Josef
HAYDN, which had been appropriated by Germany in 1922 and was
thereafter associated with the Nazi regime; a gender-neutral
version of the lyrics was adopted by the Austrian Federal Assembly
in fall 2011 and became effective 1 January 2012<br/>
         <br/>

composer Johann STRAUSS II, is consistently referred to as

with some state funding; this is based on fiber networks supported
by 5G, with the Mobile Network Operators able to expand the reach
of their 5G services following auctions held in March 2019 and
September 2020; the fixed-line broadband market is still dominated
by the DSL sector, while the cable broadband sector has held a

is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth

(earlier airmail services had been set up in a few parts of the
world but only for short stretches, and none lasted beyond a few
days or weeks); an expansion of the route in June of 1918 allowed
private mail to be flown to Kyiv, in newly independent Ukraine,
which made the route the world's first regular international
