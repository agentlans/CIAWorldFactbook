   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Once the center of power for the large Austro-Hungarian Empire,
Austria was reduced to a small republic after its defeat in World
War I. Following annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938 and subsequent
occupation by the victorious Allies in 1945, Austria's status
remained unclear for a decade. A State Treaty signed in 1955 ended
the occupation, recognized Austria's independence, and forbade
unification with Germany. A constitutional law that same year
declared the country's "perpetual neutrality" as a condition for
Soviet military withdrawal. The Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 and
Austria's entry into the EU in 1995 somewhat altered the meaning of
this neutrality. A prosperous, democratic country, Austria entered
the EU Economic and Monetary Union in 1999.</subsection>

flag design is certainly one of the oldest - if not the oldest -
national banners in the world; according to tradition, in 1191,
following a fierce battle in the Third Crusade, Duke Leopold V of
Austria's white tunic became completely blood-spattered; upon
removal of his wide belt or sash, a white band was revealed; the
red-white-red color combination was subsequently adopted as his
