   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Upon independence in 1960, the former French region of Middle
Congo became the Republic of the Congo. A quarter century of
experimentation with Marxism was abandoned in 1990 and a
democratically elected government took office in 1992. A two-year
civil war that ended in 1999 restored former Marxist President
Denis SASSOU-Nguesso, who had ruled from 1979 to 1992, and sparked
a short period of ethnic and political unrest that was resolved by
a peace agreement in late 1999. A new constitution adopted three
years later provided for a multi-party system and a seven-year
presidential term, and elections arranged shortly thereafter
retained SASSOU-Nguesso. Following a year of renewed fighting,
President SASSOU-Nguesso and southern-based rebel groups agreed to
a final peace accord in March 2003. SASSOU-Nguesso was reeelected
in 2009 and, after passing a referendum allowing him to run for a
third term, was reelected again in 2016. The Republic of Congo is
one of Africa's largest petroleum producers, but with declining
production it will need new offshore oil finds to sustain its oil
earnings over the long term.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">The Republic of the Congo is one of the most urbanized countries
in Africa, with nearly 70% of Congolese living in urban
areas.  The population is concentrated in the southwest of the
country, mainly in the capital Brazzaville, Pointe-Noire, and along
the railway line that connects the two.  The tropical jungles
in the north of the country are sparsely populated.  Most
Congolese are Bantu, and most belong to one of four main ethnic
groups, the Kongo, Teke, Mbochi, and Sangha, which consist of over
70 subgroups.The Republic of Congo is in the early stages of a demographic
transition, whereby a population shifts from high fertility and
mortality rates to low fertility and mortality rates associated
with industrialized societies.  Its total fertility rate
(TFR), the average number of children born per woman, remains high
at 4.4 as of 2022.  While its TFR has steadily decreased, the
progress slowed beginning in about 1995.  The slowdown in
fertility reduction has delayed the demographic transition and
Congo’s potential to reap a demographic dividend, the economic
boost that can occur when the share of the working-age population
is larger than the dependent age groups. The TFR differs significantly between urban and rural areas –
3.7 in urban areas versus 6.5 in rural areas.  The TFR also
varies among regions.  The urban regions of Brazzaville and
Pointe-Noire have much lower TFRs than other regions, which are
predominantly or completely rural.  The gap between desired
fertility and actual fertility is also greatest in rural
areas.  Rural families may have more children to contribute to
agricultural production and/or due to a lack of information about
and access to contraception.  Urban families may prefer to
have fewer children because raising them is more expensive and
balancing work and childcare may be more difficult.  The
number of births among teenage girls, the frequency of giving birth
before the age of fifteen, and a lack of education are the most
likely reasons for higher TFRs in rural areas.  Although 90%
of school-age children are enrolled in primary school, repetition
and dropout rates are high and the quality of education is
poor.  Congolese women with no or little education start
having children earlier and have more children in total than those
with at least some secondary education. </subsection>

      <subsection title="Military - note">the FAC is viewed as having limited capabilities due to
obsolescent and poorly maintained equipment and low levels of
training; its primary focus is internal security; since its
creation in 1961, the FAC has had a turbulent history; it has been
sidelined by some national leaders in favor of personal militias,
endured an internal rebellion (1996), and clashed with various
rebel groups and political or ethnic militias (1993-1996,
2002-2005, 2017); during the 1997-1999 civil war, the military
generally split along ethnic lines, with most northern officers
supporting eventual winner SASSOU-Nguesso, and most southerners
backing the rebels; others joined ethnic-based factions loyal to
regional warlords; forces backing SASSOU-Nguesso were supported by
Angolan troops and received some French assistance; the FAC also
has undergone at least three reorganizations that included the
incorporation of former rebel combatants and various ethnic and
political militias; in recent years, France has provided some
advice and training, and a military cooperation agreement was
signed with Russia in 2019 (2022)</subsection>
