   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">In the 10th century, Muslim merchants established some of The
Gambia’s earliest large settlements as trans-Saharan trade hubs.
These settlements eventually grew into major export centers sending
slaves, gold, and ivory across the Sahara. Between the 16th and
17th centuries, European colonial powers began establishing trade
with The Gambia. In 1664, the United Kingdom established a colony
in The Gambia focused on exporting enslaved people across the
Atlantic. During the roughly 300 years of the trans-Atlantic slave
trade, the UK and other European powers may have exported as many
as 3 million people from The Gambia.The Gambia gained its independence from the UK in 1965.
Geographically surrounded by Senegal, it formed the short-lived
confederation of Senegambia between 1982 and 1989. In 1994, Yahya
JAMMEH led a military coup overthrowing the president and banning
political activity. He subsequently won every presidential election
until 2016, when he lost to Adama BARROW, who headed an opposition
coalition during free and fair elections. BARROW won reelection in
December 2021. The Gambia is the only member of the Economic
Community of West African States that does not have presidential
term limits. Since the 2016 election, The Gambia and the US have
enjoyed improved relations. US assistance to the country has
supported military education and training programs, capacity
building, and democracy-strengthening activities.<br/>  </subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">The Gambia’s youthful age structure – approximately 55% of the
population is under the age of 25 as of 2021 – is likely to persist
because the country’s total fertility rate remains strong at nearly
4 children per woman. The overall literacy rate is around 50%, and
is significantly lower for women than for men. At least 70% of the
populace are farmers who are reliant on rain-fed agriculture and
cannot afford improved seeds and fertilizers. Crop failures caused
by droughts between 2011 and 2013 increased poverty, food
shortages, and malnutrition.The Gambia is a source country for migrants and a transit and
destination country for migrants and refugees. Since the 1980s,
economic deterioration, drought, and high unemployment, especially
among youths, have driven both domestic migration (largely urban)
and migration abroad (legal and illegal). Emigrants are largely
skilled workers, including doctors and nurses, and provide a
significant amount of remittances. The top receiving countries for
Gambian emigrants are Spain, the US, Nigeria, Senegal, and the UK.
While the Gambia and Spain do not share historic, cultural, or
trade ties, rural Gambians have migrated to Spain in large numbers
because of its proximity and the availability of jobs in its
underground economy (this flow slowed following the onset of
Spain’s late 2007 economic crisis).The Gambia’s role as a host country to refugees is a result of
wars in several of its neighboring West African countries. Since
2006, refugees from the Casamance conflict in Senegal have replaced
their pattern of flight and return with permanent settlement in The
Gambia, often moving in with relatives along the Senegal-Gambia
border. The strain of providing for about 7,400 Casamance refugees
increased poverty among Gambian villagers. The number of refugees
decreased to around 3,500 by 2022.</subsection>

note: on 21 March 2022, the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Travel Alert for polio in

for circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV);
vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) is a strain of the weakened
poliovirus that was initially included in oral polio vaccine (OPV)

or naturally occurring virus; this means it can be spread more
easily to people who are unvaccinated against polio and who come in
contact with the stool or respiratory secretions, such as from a
sneeze, of an “infected” person who received oral polio vaccine;
the CDC recommends that before any international travel, anyone
unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated, or with an unknown polio
vaccination status should complete the routine polio vaccine
series; before travel to any high-risk destination, CDC recommends
that adults who previously completed the full, routine polio
vaccine series receive a single, lifetime booster dose of polio

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Gambia’s telecom market has
five mobile networks providing effective competition; mobile
subscriptions are well above the African average, itself a
testament to the poor condition of the fixed-line infrastructure
and the lack of availability of fixed services in many rural areas
of the country; there are only four licensed ISPs, which are small
networks serving local areas, and so competition is minimal; their
limited services are complemented by the fixed-wireless offerings
of three of the MNOs; the government has embarked on a National
Broadband Network program aimed at closing the digital divide
affecting many parts of the country; despite efforts to improve
internet connectivity, the country ranks among the lowest globally
in terms of digital readiness. (2022)<br/>

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
