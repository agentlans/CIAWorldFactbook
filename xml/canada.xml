   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">A land of vast distances and rich natural resources, Canada
became a self-governing dominion in 1867, while retaining ties to
the British crown. Canada gained legislative independence from
Britain in 1931 and formalized its constitutional independence from
the UK when it passed the Canada Act in 1982. Economically and
technologically, the nation has developed in parallel with the US,
its neighbor to the south across the world's longest international
border. Canada faces the political challenges of meeting public
demands for quality improvements in health care, education, social
services, and economic competitiveness, as well as responding to
the particular concerns of predominantly francophone Quebec. Canada
also aims to develop its diverse energy resources while maintaining
its commitment to the environment.</subsection>
