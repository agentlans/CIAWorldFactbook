   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">A land of vast distances and rich natural resources, Canada
became a self-governing dominion in 1867, while retaining ties to
the British crown. Canada gained legislative independence from
Britain in 1931 and formalized its constitutional independence from
the UK when it passed the Canada Act in 1982. Economically and
technologically, the nation has developed in parallel with the US,
its neighbor to the south across the world's longest international
border. Canada faces the political challenges of meeting public
demands for quality improvements in health care, education, social
services, and economic competitiveness, as well as responding to
the particular concerns of predominantly francophone Quebec. Canada
also aims to develop its diverse energy resources while maintaining
its commitment to the environment.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: the Canadian telecom market
continues to show steady development as operators invest in network
upgrades; much of the investment among telcos has been channelled
into LTE infrastructure to capitalize on consumer demand for mobile
data services, while there has also been further investment in 5G;
investment programs have also been supported by regulatory efforts
to ensure that operators have spectrum available to develop 5G
services; an investment in fixed-line infrastructure, focused on
FttP and, among cable broadband providers; government policy has
encouraged the extension of broadband to rural and regional areas,
with the result that services are almost universally available and
the emphasis now is on improving service speeds to enable the
entire population to benefit from the digital economy and society;
cable broadband is the principal access platform, followed by DSL;
the mobile rate remains comparatively low by international
standards; Canadians have provided for LTE and LTE-A
infrastructure; despite topographical challenges and the remoteness
of many areas, the major players effectively offer 99% population
coverage with LTE; operators now provide up to 70% population
coverage with 5G (2022)<br/>

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

Permanent Joint Board on Defense (PJBD), which continued to be the
highest-level bilateral defense forum between Canada and the US as

Treaty of Washington; following the withdrawal, the first Canadian
militia, known as the Royal Canadian Regiment, was organized in
1883 to protect Canadian territory and defend British interests
abroad, which it did in the South African War (1899-1902), Canada’s
first overseas conflict; militia units formed the backbone of the
more than 425,000 Canadian soldiers that went to Europe during
