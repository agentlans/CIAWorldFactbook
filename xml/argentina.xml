   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">In 1816, the United Provinces of the Rio Plata declared their
independence from Spain. After Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay went
their separate ways, the area that remained became Argentina. The
country's population and culture were heavily shaped by immigrants
from throughout Europe, with Italy and Spain providing the largest
percentage of newcomers from 1860 to 1930. Up until about the
mid-20th century, much of Argentina's history was dominated by
periods of internal political unrest and conflict between civilian
and military factions.After World War II, an era of populism under former President
Juan Domingo PERON - the founder of the Peronist political movement
- and direct and indirect military interference in subsequent
governments was followed by a military junta that took power in
1976. Democracy returned in 1983 after a failed bid to seize the
Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) by force, and has persisted
despite numerous challenges, the most formidable of which was a
severe economic crisis in 2001-02 that led to violent public
protests and the successive resignations of several presidents. The
years 2003-15 saw Peronist rule by Nestor KIRCHNER (2003-07) and
his spouse Cristina FERNANDEZ DE KIRCHNER (2007-15), who oversaw
several years of strong economic growth (2003-11) followed by a
gradual deterioration in the government’s fiscal situation and
eventual economic stagnation and isolation. Argentina underwent a
brief period of economic reform and international reintegration
under Mauricio MACRI (2015-19), but a recession in 2018-19 and
frustration with MACRI’s economic policies ushered in a new
Peronist government in 2019 led by President Alberto FERNANDEZ and
Vice President FERNANDEZ DE KIRCHNER. Presidential elections will
take place next in 2023.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Argentina's population continues to grow but at a slower rate
because of its steadily declining birth rate. Argentina's fertility
decline began earlier than in the rest of Latin America, occurring
most rapidly between the early 20th century and the 1950s, and then
becoming more gradual. Life expectancy has been improving, most
notably among the young and the poor. While the population under
age 15 is shrinking, the youth cohort - ages 15-24 - is the largest
in Argentina's history and will continue to bolster the working-age
population. If this large working-age population is well-educated
and gainfully employed, Argentina is likely to experience an
economic boost and possibly higher per capita savings and
investment. Although literacy and primary school enrollment are
nearly universal, grade repetition is problematic and secondary
school completion is low. Both of these issues vary widely by
region and socioeconomic group.Argentina has been primarily a country of immigration for most
of its history, welcoming European immigrants (often providing
needed low-skilled labor) after its independence in the 19th
century and attracting especially large numbers from Spain and
Italy. More than 7 million European immigrants are estimated to
have arrived in Argentina between 1880 and 1930, when it adopted a
more restrictive immigration policy. European immigration also
began to wane in the 1930s because of the global depression. The
inflow rebounded temporarily following WWII and resumed its decline
in the 1950s when Argentina's military dictators tightened
immigration rules and European economies rebounded. Regional
migration increased, however, supplying low-skilled workers
escaping economic and political instability in their home
countries. As of 2015, immigrants made up almost 5% of Argentina's
population, the largest share in South America. Migration from
neighboring countries accounted for approximately 80% of
Argentina's immigrant population in 2015.The first waves of highly skilled Argentine emigrant workers
headed mainly to the United States and Spain in the 1960s and
1970s, driven by economic decline and repressive military
dictatorships. The 2008 European economic crisis drove the return
migration of some Argentinean and other Latin American nationals,
as well as the immigration of Europeans to South America, where
Argentina was a key recipient. In 2015, Argentina received the
highest number of legal migrants in Latin America and the
Caribbean. The majority of its migrant inflow came from Paraguay
and Bolivia.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">Argentina’s ongoing problem with hyperinflation continues to distort the telecom market’s performance, which shows strong growth in revenue but only modest gains in subscriber numbers each year; the fixed broadband segment has penetration levels only slightly higher than the fixed-line teledensity; nearly a quarter of the country’s broadband connections are via DSL, although fiber is starting claim an increasing share of that market as networks expand across most of the main cities; mobile broadband continues to be the preferred platform for internet access, supported by high mobile penetration levels and nationwide LTE coverage; the first 5G service was launched in February 2021 using refarmed LTE frequencies; the anticipated 5G spectrum auctions should drive even stronger uptake in mobile broadband services; while the various fixed, mobile, and cable operators push to expand and enhance their services, the government is also making an active contribution towards boosting broadband connectivity around the country; its national connectivity plan ‘Plan Conectar’, launched in September 2020, provides funding for a range of programs to increase coverage; in August 2021, the telecom regulator announced the release funding to help operators accelerate the rollout of their broadband infrastructure and services (2021)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>

War of Independence, while the Air Force was established in 1945;
the military coups d'état in 1930, 1943, 1955, 1962, 1966, and
1976; the 1976 coup, aka the "National Reorganization Process,"
marked the beginning of the so-called "Dirty War," a period of
state-sponsored terrorism that saw the deaths or disappearances of
thousands of Argentinians; the defeat in the 1983 Falklands War led
to the downfall of the military junta

Argentina and Chile have a joint peacekeeping force known as the
Combined Southern Cross Peacekeeping Force (FPC), designed to be
made available to the UN; the FPC is made up of two battalions, one
from each country, a command and service company, an air component
(a squadron of Argentine and Chilean helicopters), a naval
component, and a combined logistics support unit

Argentina has Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA) status with the US; MNNA
is a designation under US law that provides foreign partners with
certain benefits in the areas of defense trade and security
cooperation; while MNNA status provides military and economic
privileges, it does not entail any security commitments (2022)</subsection>

constitution, forcibly occupying the Falklands in 1982, but in 1995
agreed to no longer seek settlement by force; UK continues to
