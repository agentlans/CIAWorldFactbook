   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The islands were first populated by voyagers from either Samoa
or Tonga in the first millennium A.D., and Tuvalu provided a
steppingstone for various Polynesian communities that subsequently
settled in Melanesia and Micronesia. Tuvalu eventually came under
Samoan and Tongan spheres of influence although proximity to
Micronesia allowed some Micronesian communities to flourish in
Tuvalu, in particular on Nui Atoll. In the late 1700s and early
1800s, Tuvalu was visited by a series of American, British, Dutch,
and Russian ships. The islands were named the Ellice Islands in
1819. The first Christian missionaries arrived in 1861, eventually
converting most of the population, and around the same time,
several hundred Tuvaluans were kidnapped by people purporting to be
missionaries and sent to work on plantations in Peru and
Hawaii.

The UK declared a protectorate over the Ellice Islands in 1892 and
merged it with the Micronesian Gilbert Islands. The Gilbert and
Ellice Islands Protectorate became a colony in 1916. During World
War II, the US set up military bases on a few islands, and in 1943,
after Japan captured many of the northern Gilbert Islands, the UK
transferred administration of the colony southward to Funafuti.
After the war, Tarawa in the Gilbert Islands was once again made
the colony’s capital and the center of power was firmly in the
Gilbert Islands, including the colony’s only secondary school. Amid
growing tensions with the Gilbertese, Tuvaluans voted to secede
from the colony in 1974, were granted self-rule in 1975, and gained
independence in 1978 as Tuvalu. In 1979, the US relinquished its
claims to Tuvaluan islands in a treaty of friendship.
The Tuvalu Trust Fund was established in 1987 to provide a longterm
economic future for the country. In 2000, Tuvalu negotiated a
contract leasing its Internet domain name ".tv" for $50 million in
royalties over a 12-year period. The contract was renewed in 2011
for a ten-year period. Tuvalu’s isolation means it sees few
tourists; in 2020, Funafuti International Airport had four weekly
flights - three to Suva, Fiji, and one to Tarawa. Tuvalu is highly
vulnerable to the effects of climate change; in 2018, sea levels in
Funafuti were rising twice as fast as global averages.</subsection>
