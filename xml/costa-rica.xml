   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Although explored by the Spanish early in the 16th century,
initial attempts at colonizing Costa Rica proved unsuccessful due
to a combination of factors, including disease from
mosquito-infested swamps, brutal heat, resistance by indigenous
populations, and pirate raids. It was not until 1563 that a
permanent settlement of Cartago was established in the cooler,
fertile central highlands. The area remained a colony for some two
and a half centuries. In 1821, Costa Rica became one of several
Central American provinces that jointly declared their independence
from Spain. Two years later it joined the United Provinces of
Central America, but this federation disintegrated in 1838, at
which time Costa Rica proclaimed its sovereignty and independence.
Since the late 19th century, only two brief periods of violence
have marred the country's democratic development. On 1 December
1948, Costa Rica dissolved its armed forces. Although it still
maintains a large agricultural sector, Costa Rica has expanded its
economy to include strong technology and tourism industries. The
standard of living is relatively high. Land ownership is
widespread.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Costa Rica's political stability, high standard of living, and
well-developed social benefits system set it apart from its Central
American neighbors. Through the government's sustained social
spending - almost 20% of GDP annually - Costa Rica has made
tremendous progress toward achieving its goal of providing
universal access to education, healthcare, clean water, sanitation,
and electricity. Since the 1970s, expansion of these services has
led to a rapid decline in infant mortality, an increase in life
expectancy at birth, and a sharp decrease in the birth rate. The
average number of children born per women has fallen from about 7
in the 1960s to 3.5 in the early 1980s to below replacement level
today. Costa Rica's poverty rate is lower than in most Latin
American countries, but it has stalled at around 20% for almost two
decades.Costa Rica is a popular regional immigration destination because
of its job opportunities and social programs. Almost 9% of the
population is foreign-born, with Nicaraguans comprising nearly
three-quarters of the foreign population. Many Nicaraguans who
perform unskilled seasonal labor enter Costa Rica illegally or
overstay their visas, which continues to be a source of tension.
Less than 3% of Costa Rica's population lives abroad. The
overwhelming majority of expatriates have settled in the United
States after completing a university degree or in order to work in
a highly skilled field.</subsection>

white, and blue, with the coat of arms in a white elliptical disk
placed toward the hoist side of the red band; Costa Rica retained
the earlier blue-white-blue flag of Central America until 1848
when, in response to revolutionary activity in Europe, it was
decided to incorporate the French colors into the national flag and
a central red stripe was added; today the blue color is said to
stand for the sky, opportunity, and perseverance, white denotes
peace, happiness, and wisdom, while red represents the blood shed
for freedom, as well as the generosity and vibrancy of the
people<br/>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: the fixed broadband market
is one of the few parts of Costa Rica’s telecom sector to
experience solid growth in recent years, both in size and revenue;
the country’s fiber network expanded by 56% in 2020, reaching about
176,200km; fixed-line broadband traffic volume also increased by
more than 30%, year-on-year;  other areas of the market have
proven relatively lack luster, with slow or even negative growth;
some of this can be attributed to the economic and social impacts
of the pandemic, but the fixed-line and mobile sectors have both
been struggling to produce decent results since well before the
start of the crisis; the rollout of 5G network infrastructure in
Costa Rica is unlikely to occur to any scale before 2023, but this
may be one of the few remaining areas of opportunity open to
investors outside of fixed-line internet and pay TV services
(2021)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: roughly 11 per 100 fixed-line and 148
per 100 mobile-cellular; point-to-point and point-to-multi-point
microwave, fiber-optic, and coaxial cable link rural areas;
Internet service is available (2020)<br/>

satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) (2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>

over the delimitations of the San Juan River and the northern tip
of Calero Island to the International Court of Justice (ICJ); in
2009, the ICJ ruled that Costa Rican vessels carrying out police
activities could not use the river, but official Costa Rican
vessels providing essential services to riverside inhabitants and
Costa Rican tourists could travel freely on the river; in 2011, the
ICJ provisionally ruled that both countries must remove personnel
from the disputed area; in 2013, the ICJ rejected Nicaragua's 2012
suit to halt Costa Rica's construction of a highway paralleling the
river on the grounds of irreparable environmental damage; in 2013,
the ICJ, regarding the disputed territory, ordered that Nicaragua
should refrain from dredging or canal construction and refill and
repair damage caused by trenches connecting the river to the
Caribbean and upheld its 2010 ruling that Nicaragua must remove all
personnel; in early 2014, Costa Rica brought Nicaragua to the ICJ
over offshore oil concessions in the disputed region</subsection>
