   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Although explored by the Spanish early in the 16th century,
initial attempts at colonizing Costa Rica proved unsuccessful due
to a combination of factors, including disease from
mosquito-infested swamps, brutal heat, resistance by indigenous
populations, and pirate raids. It was not until 1563 that a
permanent settlement of Cartago was established in the cooler,
fertile central highlands. The area remained a colony for some two
and a half centuries. In 1821, Costa Rica became one of several
Central American provinces that jointly declared their independence
from Spain. Two years later it joined the United Provinces of
Central America, but this federation disintegrated in 1838, at
which time Costa Rica proclaimed its sovereignty and independence.
Since the late 19th century, only two brief periods of violence
have marred the country's democratic development. On 1 December
1948, Costa Rica dissolved its armed forces. Although it still
maintains a large agricultural sector, Costa Rica has expanded its
economy to include strong technology and tourism industries. The
standard of living is relatively high. Land ownership is
widespread.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">Costa Rica's political stability, high standard of living, and
well-developed social benefits system set it apart from its Central
American neighbors. Through the government's sustained social
spending - almost 20% of GDP annually - Costa Rica has made
tremendous progress toward achieving its goal of providing
universal access to education, healthcare, clean water, sanitation,
and electricity. Since the 1970s, expansion of these services has
led to a rapid decline in infant mortality, an increase in life
expectancy at birth, and a sharp decrease in the birth rate. The
average number of children born per women has fallen from about 7
in the 1960s to 3.5 in the early 1980s to below replacement level
today. Costa Rica's poverty rate is lower than in most Latin
American countries, but it has stalled at around 20% for almost two
decades.Costa Rica is a popular regional immigration destination because
of its job opportunities and social programs. Almost 9% of the
population is foreign-born, with Nicaraguans comprising nearly
three-quarters of the foreign population. Many Nicaraguans who
perform unskilled seasonal labor enter Costa Rica illegally or
overstay their visas, which continues to be a source of tension.
Less than 3% of Costa Rica's population lives abroad. The
overwhelming majority of expatriates have settled in the United
States after completing a university degree or in order to work in
a highly skilled field.</subsection>

white, and blue, with the coat of arms in a white elliptical disk
placed toward the hoist side of the red band; Costa Rica retained
the earlier blue-white-blue flag of Central America until 1848
when, in response to revolutionary activity in Europe, it was
decided to incorporate the French colors into the national flag and
a central red stripe was added; today the blue color is said to
stand for the sky, opportunity, and perseverance, white denotes
peace, happiness, and wisdom, while red represents the blood shed
for freedom, as well as the generosity and vibrancy of the
people
