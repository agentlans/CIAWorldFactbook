   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Ukraine was the center of the first eastern Slavic state, Kyivan
Rus, which during the 10th and 11th centuries was the largest and
most powerful state in Europe. Weakened by internecine quarrels and
Mongol invasions, Kyivan Rus was incorporated into the Grand Duchy
of Lithuania and eventually into the Polish-Lithuanian
Commonwealth. The cultural and religious legacy of Kyivan Rus laid
the foundation for Ukrainian nationalism through subsequent
centuries. A new Ukrainian state, the Cossack Hetmanate, was
established during the mid-17th century after an uprising against
the Poles. Despite continuous Muscovite pressure, the Hetmanate
managed to remain autonomous for well over 100 years. During the
latter part of the 18th century, most Ukrainian ethnographic
territory was absorbed by the Russian Empire. Following the
collapse of czarist Russia in 1917, Ukraine achieved a short-lived
period of independence (1917-20) but was reconquered and endured a
brutal Soviet rule that engineered two forced famines (1921-22 and
1932-33) in which over 8 million died. In World War II, German and
Soviet armies were responsible for 7 to 8 million more deaths.
Although Ukraine achieved independence in 1991 with the dissolution
of the USSR, democracy and prosperity remained elusive as the
legacy of state control and endemic corruption stalled efforts at
economic reform, privatization, and civil liberties.A peaceful mass protest referred to as the "Orange Revolution"
in the closing months of 2004 forced the authorities to overturn a
rigged presidential election and to allow a new internationally
monitored vote that swept into power a reformist slate under Viktor
YUSHCHENKO. Subsequent internal squabbles in the YUSHCHENKO camp
allowed his rival Viktor YANUKOVYCH to stage a comeback in
parliamentary (Rada) elections, become prime minister in August
2006, and be elected president in February 2010. In October 2012,
Ukraine held Rada elections, widely criticized by Western observers
as flawed due to use of government resources to favor ruling party
candidates, interference with media access, and harassment of
opposition candidates. President YANUKOVYCH's backtracking on a
trade and cooperation agreement with the EU in November 2013 - in
favor of closer economic ties with Russia - and subsequent use of
force against students, civil society activists, and other
civilians in favor of the agreement led to a three-month protest
occupation of Kyiv's central square. The government's use of
violence to break up the protest camp in February 2014 led to all
out pitched battles, scores of deaths, international condemnation,
a failed political deal, and the president's abrupt departure for
Russia. New elections in the spring allowed pro-West president
Petro POROSHENKO to assume office in June 2014; he was succeeded by
Volodymyr ZELENSKY in May 2019.Shortly after YANUKOVYCH's departure in late February 2014,
Russian President PUTIN ordered the invasion of Ukraine's Crimean
Peninsula falsely claiming the action was to protect ethnic
Russians living there. Two weeks later, a "referendum" was held
regarding the integration of Crimea into the Russian Federation.
The "referendum" was condemned as illegitimate by the Ukrainian
Government, the EU, the US, and the UN General Assembly (UNGA). In
response to Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, 100 members of
the UN passed UNGA resolution 68/262, rejecting the "referendum" as
baseless and invalid and confirming the sovereignty, political
independence, unity, and territorial integrity of Ukraine. In
mid-2014, Russia began supplying proxies in two of Ukraine's
eastern provinces with manpower, funding, and materiel driving an
armed conflict with the Ukrainian Government that continues to this
day. Representatives from Ukraine, Russia, and the unrecognized
Russian proxy republics signed the Minsk Protocol and Memorandum in
September 2014 to end the conflict. However, this agreement failed
to stop the fighting or find a political solution. In a renewed
attempt to alleviate ongoing clashes, leaders of Ukraine, Russia,
France, and Germany negotiated a follow-on Package of Measures in
February 2015 to implement the Minsk agreements. Representatives
from Ukraine, Russia, the unrecognized Russian proxy republics, and
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe also meet
regularly to facilitate implementation of the peace deal. By early
2022, more than 14,000 civilians were killed or wounded as a result
of the Russian intervention in eastern Ukraine.<br/>
         <br/>
On 24 February 2022, Russia escalated its conflict with Ukraine by
invading the country on several fronts in what has become the
largest conventional military attack on a sovereign state in Europe
since World War II. The invasion has received near universal
international condemnation, and many countries have imposed
sanctions on Russia and supplied humanitarian and military aid to
Ukraine. Russia made substantial gains in the early weeks of the
invasion but underestimated Ukrainian resolve and combat
capabilities. By the end of 2022, Ukrainian forces had regained all
territories in the north and northeast and made some advances in
the east and south. Nonetheless, Russia in late September 2022
unilaterally declared its annexation of four Ukrainian oblasts -
Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia - even though none was
fully under Russian control. The annexations remain unrecognized by
the international community.<br/>
         <br/>
The invasion has also created Europe's largest refugee crisis since
World War II. As of 7 February, 2023, approximately 18.38 million
people had fled Ukraine, and 6.54 million people were internally
displaced as of October 2022.  More than 18,800 civilian
casualties had been reported, as of 5 February 2023. The invasion
of Ukraine remains one of the two largest displacement crises
worldwide (the other is the conflict in Syria).<br/>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: the Ukraine government
announced grand plans in November 2020 to enable the commercial
launch of 5G mobile services by the end of 2021 (including a
spectrum auction slated for October), there has been very little
progress made regarding that plan; growth in the mobile sector is
flat, while the market waits for the regulator and the three
dominant MNOs to move towards making faster and more powerful
services available for public consumption (2021)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line teledensity is nearly 8 per
100; the mobile-cellular telephone system's expansion has slowed,
largely due to saturation of the market that is now just over 129
mobile phones per 100 persons (2020)<br/>
         <br/>
international: country code - 380; landing point
for the Kerch Strait Cable connecting Ukraine to Russia; 2 new
domestic trunk lines are a part of the fiber-optic TAE system and 3
Ukrainian links have been installed in the fiber-optic TEL project
that connects 18 countries; additional international service is
provided by the Italy-Turkey-Ukraine-Russia (ITUR) fiber-optic
submarine cable and by an unknown number of earth stations in the
Intelsat, Inmarsat, and Intersputnik satellite systems<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
      <subsection title="Broadcast media">Ukraine’s media landscape is dominated by oligarch-owned news
outlets, which are often politically motivated and at odds with one
another and/or the government; while polls suggest most Ukrainians
still receive news from traditional media sources, social media is
a crucial component of information dissemination in Ukraine; almost
all Ukrainian politicians and opinion leaders communicate with the
public via social media and maintain at least one social media
page, if not more; this allows them direct communication with
audiences, and news often breaks on Facebook or Twitter before
being picked up by traditional news outletsUkraine television serves as the principal source of news; the
largest national networks are controlled by oligarchs: TRK Ukraina
is owned by Rinat Akhmetov; Studio 1+1 is owned by Ihor
Kolomoyskyy; Inter is owned by Dmytro Firtash and Serhiy
Lyovochkin; and StarlightMedia channels (ICTV, STB, and Novyi
Kanal) are owned by Victor Pinchuk;  a set of 24-hour
news channels also have clear political affiliations: pro-Ukrainian
government Channel 5 and Pryamyi are linked to President Petro
Poroshenko; 24 is owned by opposition, but not pro-Russian,
politicians; UA: Suspilne is a public television station under the
umbrella of the National Public Broadcasting Company of Ukraine;
while it is often praised by media experts for balanced coverage,
it lags in popularity; Ukrainian Radio, institutionally linked to
UA: Suspilne, is one of only two national talk radio networks, with
the other being the privately owned Radio NV</subsection>
