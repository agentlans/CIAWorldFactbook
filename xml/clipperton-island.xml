   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">This isolated atoll was named for John CLIPPERTON, an English
pirate who was rumored to have made it his hideout early in the
18th century. Annexed by France in 1855 and claimed by the US, it
was seized by Mexico in 1897. Arbitration eventually awarded the
island to France in 1931, which took possession in 1935.</subsection>
