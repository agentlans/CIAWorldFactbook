   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Settlers from Papua arrived on Solomon Islands around 30,000
years ago. About 6,000 years ago, Austronesian settlers came to
Solomon Islands and the two groups mixed extensively. Despite
significant inter-island trade, no attempts were made to unite the
islands into a single political entity. In 1568, Spanish explorer
Alvaro de MENDANA became the first European to spot the islands.
After a failed Spanish attempt at creating a permanent European
settlement on the islands in the late 1500s, Solomon Islands
remained free of European contact until 1767 when British explorer
Philip CARTERET sailed by the islands. The islands were regularly
visited by European explorers and American and British whaling
ships into the 1800s, followed by missionaries in the 1850s.<br/>
         <br/>
Germany declared a protectorate over the northern Solomon Islands
in 1885, and the UK established a protectorate over the southern
islands in 1893. In 1899, Germany transferred its Solomon Islands
to the UK in exchange for the UK relinquishing all claims in Samoa.
The UK tried to encourage plantation farming, but few Europeans
were willing to go to Solomon Islands and the UK left most services
- such as education and medical services - to missionaries. In
1942, Japan invaded Solomon Islands and significant battles against
Allied forces during the Guadalcanal Campaign proved a turning
point in the Pacific war. World War II destroyed large parts of
Solomon Islands and a nationalism movement emerged near the end of
the war. By 1960, the British relented to allow for some local
autonomy. The islands were granted self-government in 1976 and
independence two years later under Prime Minister Sir Peter
KENILOREA.<br/>
         <br/>
In 1999, longstanding ethnic tensions between ethnic Guale in
Honiara and ethnic Malaitans in Honiara’s suburbs erupted in civil
war, leading thousands of Malaitans to take refuge in Honiara and
Guale to flee the city. In 2000, newly-elected Prime Minister
Manasseh SOGAVARE focused on peace agreements and distributing
resources equally among groups, but his actions bankrupted the
government in 2001 and led to SOGAVARE’s ouster. In 2003, Solomon
Islands requested international assistance to reestablish law and
order. The Australian-led Regional Assistance Mission to the
Solomon Islands, which ended in 2017, was generally effective in
improving the security situation. In 2006, riots broke out in
Honiara and the city’s Chinatown burned over allegations that the
prime minister took money from China. SOGAVARE was reelected prime
minister for a fourth time following elections in 2019 and that
same year announced Solomon Islands would switch diplomatic
recognition from Taiwan to China. In late November 2021,
protestors, mostly from the island of Malaita, calling for
SOGAVARE’s removal and more development in Malaita, sparked rioting
in Honiara. </subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: mobile services have
continually expanded in the Solomon Islands; 3G services became
available in 2010, leading to an increase in mobile broadband
uptake; Solomon Islands currently host three ISPs; fixed broadband
services are largely limited to government, corporations, and
educational organizations in the Solomon Islands; telecommunication
infrastructure in the Solomon Islands requires significant
investment due to the geographical make-up of the islands; this
presents a great challenge to rural connectivity in the country;
although various international organizations such as the World Bank
and the Asian Development Bank have taken a special interest in
having communication services improved in both the Solomon Islands
and the Pacific region in general, internet and broadband
penetration remain low; the provision of broadband infrastructure,
particularly to rural areas, is also hindered by land disputes;
internet services have, improved with the build-out of the Coral
Sea Cable System linking Papua New Guinea to the Solomon Islands,
as also with a connecting cable to a landing station at Sydney; the
Australian government provided most of the funding for the Coral
Sea Cable System, with contributions and support from the Solomon
Islands and Papua New Guinea governments; the launch of the
Kacific-1 satellite in late 2019 also improved broadband satellite
capacity for the region, though for telcos in Solomon Islands
satellite services are now largely used as backup for international
traffic; in recent years, the country has stabilized both
politically and economically and this, along with improvements to
mobile infrastructure, has led to a rise in mobile services and the
slow uptake of broadband services; while the first LTE services
were launched in late 2017 in the capital Honiara, the main
platform for mobile voice and data services remains 3G, while in
outlying areas GSM is still an important technology for the
provision of services (2022)<br/>
         <br/>
domestic: fixed-line is just over 1 per 100
persons and mobile-cellular telephone density is about 69 per 100
persons; domestic cable system to extend to key major islands

international: country code - 677; landing points
for the CSCS and ICNS2 submarine cables providing connectivity from
Solomon Islands, to PNG, Vanuatu and Australia; satellite earth
station - 1 Intelsat (Pacific Ocean) (2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
