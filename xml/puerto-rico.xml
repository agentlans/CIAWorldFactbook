   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Populated for centuries by aboriginal peoples, the island was
claimed by the Spanish Crown in 1493 following Christopher
COLUMBUS' second voyage to the Americas. In 1898, after 400 years
of colonial rule that saw the indigenous population nearly
exterminated and African slave labor introduced, Puerto Rico was
ceded to the US as a result of the Spanish-American War. Puerto
Ricans were granted US citizenship in 1917. Popularly elected
governors have served since 1948. In 1952, a constitution was
enacted providing for internal self-government. In plebiscites held
in 1967, 1993, and 1998, voters chose not to alter the existing
political status with the US, but the results of a 2012 vote left
open the possibility of American statehood. Economic recession on
the island has led to a net population loss since about 2005, as
large numbers of residents moved to the US mainland. The trend has
accelerated since 2010; in 2014, Puerto Rico experienced a net
population loss to the mainland of 64,000, more than double the net
loss of 26,000 in 2010. Hurricane Maria struck the island on 20
September 2017 causing catastrophic damage, including destruction
of the electrical grid that had been crippled by Hurricane Irma
just two weeks before. It was the worst storm to hit the island in
eight decades, and damage is estimated in the tens of billions of
dollars. A referendum held in late 2020 showed a narrow preference
for American statehood.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">Puerto Rico has a small telecom market which in recent years has been deeply affected by a combination of economic mismanagement and natural disasters, including two hurricanes which landed in late 2017 and an earthquake which struck in January 2020; these disasters caused considerable destruction of telecom infrastructure, which in turn led to a marked decline in the number of subscribers for all services; compounding these difficulties have been a long-term economic downturn which encouraged many people not to resume telecom services after these were restored; after some delay, the FCC in late 2019 issued an order relating to the release of funds to help rebuild telecom infrastructure; although Puerto Rico is a US territory it lags well behind the mainland US states in terms of fixed-line and broadband services; this is partly due to high unemployment rates (and consequently low disposable income) and poor telecoms investment in a market; the mobile market has been impacted by several mergers and acquisitions over the last few years; the activities of large multinational telcos continue to impact the Puerto Rican market; operators have secured spectrum in the 600MHz and 3.5GHz bands, thus enabling them to expand the reach of LTE services and launch services based on 5G;  the growing number of submarine cables landing in Puerto Rico is helping to drive down the cost of telecom services, creating a demand for streaming content from abroad; the uptake of cloud-based applications for both business and individuals is also creating a heightened demand for affordable services (2021)</note>

         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>
