   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">Populated for centuries by aboriginal peoples, the island was
claimed by the Spanish Crown in 1493 following Christopher
COLUMBUS' second voyage to the Americas. In 1898, after 400 years
of colonial rule that saw the indigenous population nearly
exterminated and African slave labor introduced, Puerto Rico was
ceded to the US as a result of the Spanish-American War. Puerto
Ricans were granted US citizenship in 1917. Popularly elected
governors have served since 1948. In 1952, a constitution was
enacted providing for internal self-government. In plebiscites held
in 1967, 1993, and 1998, voters chose not to alter the existing
political status with the US, but the results of a 2012 vote left
open the possibility of American statehood. Economic recession on
the island has led to a net population loss since about 2005, as
large numbers of residents moved to the US mainland. The trend has
accelerated since 2010; in 2014, Puerto Rico experienced a net
population loss to the mainland of 64,000, more than double the net
loss of 26,000 in 2010. Hurricane Maria struck the island on 20
September 2017 causing catastrophic damage, including destruction
of the electrical grid that had been crippled by Hurricane Irma
just two weeks before. It was the worst storm to hit the island in
eight decades, and damage is estimated in the tens of billions of
dollars. A referendum held in late 2020 showed a narrow preference
for American statehood.</subsection>

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Puerto Rico has a small
telecom market which in recent years has been deeply affected by a
combination of economic mismanagement and natural disasters,
including two hurricanes which landed in late 2017 and an
earthquake which struck in January 2020; these disasters caused
considerable destruction of telecom infrastructure, which in turn
led to a marked decline in the number of subscribers for all
services; compounding these difficulties have been a long-term
economic downturn which encouraged many people not to resume
telecom services after these were restored; after some delay, the
FCC in late 2019 issued an order relating to the release of funds
to help rebuild telecom infrastructure; although Puerto Rico is a
US territory it lags well behind the mainland US states in terms of
fixed-line and broadband services; this is partly due to high
unemployment rates (and consequently low disposable income) and
poor telecoms investment in a market; the mobile market has been
impacted by several mergers and acquisitions over the last few
years; the activities of large multinational telcos continue to
impact the Puerto Rican market; operators have secured spectrum in
the 600MHz and 3.5GHz bands, thus enabling them to expand the reach
of LTE services and launch services based on 5G;  the growing
number of submarine cables landing in Puerto Rico is helping to
drive down the cost of telecom services, creating a demand for
streaming content from abroad; the uptake of cloud-based
applications for both business and individuals is also creating a
heightened demand for affordable services (2021)<br/>

         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
