   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">The Berber and Bafour people were among the first to settle in
what is now Mauritania. Originally a nomadic people, they were
among the first in recorded history to convert from a nomadic to
agricultural lifestyle. These groups account for roughly one third
of Mauritania’s ethnic makeup. The remainder of Mauritania’s ethnic
groups derive from former enslaved peoples and Sub-Saharan ethnic
groups originating mainly from the Senegal River Valley. These
three groups are organized according to a strict caste system with
deep ethnic divides that still exist today.

A former French colony, Mauritania achieved independence from
France in 1960. Mauritania initially began as a single-party,
authoritarian regime and saw 49 years of dictatorships, flawed
elections, failed attempts at democracy, and military coups. Ould
Abdel AZIZ led the last coup in 2008, and was elected president in
2009 and reelected in 2014. Mohamed Ould Cheikh GHAZOUANI was
elected president in 2019, and his inauguration marked the first
peaceful transition of power from one democratically elected
president to another, solidifying Mauritania’s status as an
emerging democracy. International observers recognized the
elections as relatively free and fair.The country is working to address a continuing practice of
slavery and its vestiges. Mauritania officially abolished slavery
in 1981, but the practice was not criminalized until 2007. Between
2005 and 2011, Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) launched a
series of attacks killing American and foreign tourists and aid
workers, attacking diplomatic and government facilities, and
ambushing Mauritanian soldiers and gendarmes. Although Mauritania
has not seen an attack since 2011, AQIM and similar groups remain
active in the Sahel region. </subsection>

      <subsection title="Demographic profile">With a sustained total fertility rate of about 3.5 children per
woman and almost 60% of the population under the age of 25 as of
2020, Mauritania's population is likely to continue growing for the
foreseeable future. Mauritania's large youth cohort is vital to its
development prospects, but available schooling does not adequately
prepare students for the workplace. Girls continue to be
underrepresented in the classroom, educational quality remains
poor, and the dropout rate is high. The literacy rate is only about
50%, even though access to primary education has improved since the
mid-2000s. Women's restricted access to education and
discriminatory laws maintain gender inequality - worsened by early
and forced marriages and female genital cutting.The denial of education to black Moors also helps to perpetuate
slavery. Although Mauritania abolished slavery in 1981 (the last
country in the world to do so) and made it a criminal offense in
2007, the millenniums-old practice persists largely because
anti-slavery laws are rarely enforced and the custom is so
ingrained.  According to a 2018 nongovernmental organization's
report, a little more than 2% of Mauritania's population is
enslaved, which includes individuals subjected to forced labor and
forced marriage, while many thousands of individuals who are
legally free contend with discrimination, poor education, and a
lack of identity papers and, therefore, live in de facto
slavery.  The UN and international press outlets have claimed
that up to 20% of Mauritania's population is enslaved, which would
be the highest rate worldwide.Drought, poverty, and unemployment have driven outmigration from
Mauritania since the 1970s. Early flows were directed toward other
West African countries, including Senegal, Mali, Cote d'Ivoire, and
Gambia. The 1989 Mauritania-Senegal conflict forced thousands of
black Mauritanians to take refuge in Senegal and pushed labor
migrants toward the Gulf, Libya, and Europe in the late 1980s and
early 1990s. Mauritania has accepted migrants from neighboring
countries to fill labor shortages since its independence in 1960
and more recently has received refugees escaping civil wars,
including tens of thousands of Tuaregs who fled Mali in 2012.Mauritania was an important transit point for Sub-Saharan
migrants moving illegally to North Africa and Europe. In the
mid-2000s, as border patrols increased in the Strait of Gibraltar,
security increased around Spain's North African enclaves (Ceuta and
Melilla), and Moroccan border controls intensified, illegal
migration flows shifted from the Western Mediterranean to Spain's
Canary Islands. In 2006, departure points moved southward along the
West African coast from Morocco and then Western Sahara to
Mauritania's two key ports (Nouadhibou and the capital Nouakchott),
and illegal migration to the Canaries peaked at almost 32,000. The
numbers fell dramatically in the following years because of joint
patrolling off the West African coast by Frontex (the EU's border
protection agency), Spain, Mauritania, and Senegal; the expansion
of Spain's border surveillance system; and the 2008 European
economic downturn.</subsection>

         <note title="general assessment">Mauritania’s small population and low economic output has limited the country’s ability to develop sustained growth in the telecom sector; low disposable income has restricted growth in the use of services, and thus of revenue which telcos can hope to gain from subscribers; this has impacted on their ability to invest in network upgrades and improvements to service offerings; this has been reflected in the repeated fines imposed against them by the regulator for failing to ensure a good quality of service; there are also practical challenges relating to transparency and tax burdens which have hindered foreign investment; financial support has been forthcoming from the government as well as the World Bank and European Investment Bank; their efforts have focused on implementing appropriate regulatory measures and promoting the further penetration of fixed-line broadband services by improving the national backbone network, ensuring connectivity to international telecom cables, and facilitating operator access to infrastructure; progress has been made to improve internet bandwidth capacity, including the completion of a cable link at the border with Algeria, and the connection to the EllaLink submarine cable; the final stage of the national backbone network was completed in December 2021, which now runs to some 4,000km; penetration of fixed telephony and broadband service is very low and is expected to remain so in coming years, though growth is anticipated following improvements to backbone infrastructure and the reduction in access pricing; most voice and data services are carried over the mobile networks (2022)</note>
         <note title="domestic">fixed-line teledensity roughly 1 per 100 persons; mobile-cellular network coverage extends mainly to urban areas with a teledensity of roughly 106 per 100 persons; mostly cable and open-wire lines; a domestic satellite telecommunications system links Nouakchott with regional capitals (2020)</note>
         <note title="international">country code - 222; landing point for the ACE submarine cable for connectivity to 19 West African countries and 2 European countries; satellite earth stations - 3 (1 Intelsat - Atlantic Ocean, 2 Arabsat) (2019)</note>
         <note title="note">the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services</note>

      <subsection title="Broadcast media">12 TV stations: 6 government-owned and 6 private (the 6th was
started in early 2022, owed by the President of Mauritanian
Businessmen); in October 2017, the government suspended most
private TV stations due to non-payment of broadcasting fees, but
they later negotiated payment options with the government and are
back since 2019. There are 19 radio broadcasters: 15
government-owned, 4 (Radio Nouakchott Libre, Radio Tenwir, Radio
Kobeni and Mauritanid) private; all 4 private radio stations
broadcast from Nouakchott; of the 15 government stations, 4
broadcast from Nouakchott (Radio Mauritanie, Radio Jeunesse, Radio
Koran and Mauritanid) and the other 12 broadcast from each of the
12 regions outside Nouakchott; Radio Jeunesse and Radio Koran are
