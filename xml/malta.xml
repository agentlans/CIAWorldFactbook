   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">With a civilization that dates back thousands of years, Malta
boasts some of the oldest megalithic sites in the world. Situated
in the center of the Mediterranean, Malta’s islands have long
served as a strategic military asset, with the islands at various
times having come under control of the Phoenicians, Carthaginians,
Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Moors, Normans, Sicilians, Spanish,
Knights of St. John, and the French. Most recently a British colony
(since 1814), Malta gained its independence in 1964 and declared
itself a republic 10 years later. While under British rule, the
island staunchly supported the UK through both world wars. Since
about the mid-1980s, the island has transformed itself into a
freight transshipment point, a financial center, and a tourist
destination while its key industries moved toward more
service-oriented activities. Malta became an EU member in May 2004
and began using the euro as currency in 2008.</subsection>

explanation is that the colors are those of the Knights of Saint

      <subsection title="Telecommunication systems">general assessment: Malta’s small telecom
sector is among the most advanced in Europe; this has been helped
by the topography, which has made it relatively easy for operators
to expand the reach of their fiber infrastructure; with high mobile
and broadband penetration rates, the government and regulator have
effective strategies in place to capitalize on these infrastructure
developments to ensure that the population has among the fastest
data rates in Europe, and is well positioned to take advantage of
emerging e-commerce opportunities; the sector has also been
stimulated by regulatory measures designed to reduce consumer
prices; the incumbent telco is investing in a sub sea cable to
connect the islands to France and Egypt; expected to be ready for
service in 2022, the cable will further enhance Malta’s internet
bandwidth and lead to reduced prices for end-users; there has also
been some encouragement to increase market competition (2021)<br/>
         <br/>

100  persons and mobile-cellular subscribership 143 per 100
persons; automatic system featuring submarine cable and microwave
radio relay between islands (2020)<br/>

international: country code - 356; landing points

Malta Italy Interconnector, Melita-1, and the Italy-Malta submarine
cable connections to Italy; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat
(Atlantic Ocean) (2019)<br/>
         <br/>
note: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a
significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since
2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a
downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward
5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to
infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased
due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial
nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home
is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth
opportunities for development of new tools and increased
services</subsection>
