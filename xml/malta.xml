   <section title="Introduction">
      <subsection title="Background">With a civilization that dates back thousands of years, Malta
boasts some of the oldest megalithic sites in the world. Situated
in the center of the Mediterranean, Maltaâ€™s islands have long
served as a strategic military asset, with the islands at various
times having come under control of the Phoenicians, Carthaginians,
Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Moors, Normans, Sicilians, Spanish,
Knights of St. John, and the French. Most recently a British colony
(since 1814), Malta gained its independence in 1964 and declared
itself a republic 10 years later. While under British rule, the
island staunchly supported the UK through both world wars. Since
about the mid-1980s, the island has transformed itself into a
freight transshipment point, a financial center, and a tourist
destination while its key industries moved toward more
service-oriented activities. Malta became an EU member in May 2004
and began using the euro as currency in 2008.</subsection>

explanation is that the colors are those of the Knights of Saint

         <note title="general assessment">Maltaâ€™s small telecom sector is among the most advanced in Europe; this has been helped by the topography, which has made it relatively easy for operators to expand the reach of their fiber infrastructure; with high mobile and broadband penetration rates, the government and regulator have effective strategies in place to capitalize on these infrastructure developments to ensure that the population has among the fastest data rates in Europe, and is well positioned to take advantage of emerging e-commerce opportunities; the sector has also been stimulated by regulatory measures designed to reduce consumer prices; the incumbent telco is investing in a sub sea cable to connect the islands to France and Egypt; expected to be ready for service in 2022, the cable will further enhance Maltaâ€™s internet bandwidth and lead to reduced prices for end-users; there has also been some encouragement to increase market competition (2021)</note>
